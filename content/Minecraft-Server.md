Wow. I have been working for so long, just to get to this point. I finally have done it. Ihave made the official jacob MC server!! This might seem out of the blue, but I have been working on this more than anything.

## How to join
Because ngrok only supports TCP, I cant run a bedrock server. Sorry! To join the server, put the following into minecraft:
```
name: Jacob MC
ip: mc.jacobgoldstein.tk
**Dont Change Port**
```
Now you should be able to join the server!! If you want to help out, [email me](mailto:linuxjacob@mail.com).

## About the server
Now, the server is running off a VM on google, accessable through ssh. The domain was easily configurable also. I ran ngrok, and directed the ip to the domain name. the port is default (thanks again geyser).

## More Info
```
Gamemode: Creative
Cheats: on
permissions: member
```

## Conclusion
I finally made the server. Now i need you guys to join it. Thank you for reading!!
