# My Life So Far

So, I had an idea to just write about my life today, and that's what I'm gonna do.  Enjoy!

### Projects I am working on

* Opensuspect (more on this later)
* AlamodeBoot
* My website

### Things I have done

* CFWed my 3ds
* installed i3 and made it look cool
* got 1.4k upvotes on reddit

### Things I want to do

* Install Arch Linux
* Format my stupid corrupted SD card
* make more storage on my laptop

### Opensuspect

So, OpenSuspect is an open-source social deduction game, similar to among us. I have been part of the team since the beginning, and it has been  a lot of fun. My main contributions are the websites: [opensuspect.com](https://opensuspect.com "opensuspect.com") and [opensuspect.gq](https://opensuspect.gq "opensuspect.gq") .  If you want to help out, join our matrix chat at [https://matrix.to/#/#opensuspect:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#opensuspect:matrix.org "https://matrix.to/#/#opensuspect:matrix.org")

### Other

Yeah, so thanks for reading this!
