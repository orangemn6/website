# Making a Minecraft Server on IdleyHost

So, you probably haven't heard of idleyhost, but it is a server hosting organization based on Discord. They provide free Minecraft servers with 2gb of RAM, and have a referral system so you can get better specs. In this article I will show you how to make a 1.16.4 Paper Server

### Logging in

So when you go to the [idleyhost site](https://idleyhost.com) You need to login. Click the login with discord button, and follow the steps. Once that is done, go to the next step.

### Configuring the server

You will see a button that says "create a new server". Click that and follow the setup. I made a paper server with the name JacobMC. Next, set the max amount of ram for a free account which is **2048 MB**. Once you finish that up, follow the rest of the setup. You are almost done!

### Starting the server

To start the server, go to the control panel. Do this by going to the sidebar,and clicking "control panel credentials". Click the open control panel or control panel button. That will open the Control Panel. Click your server, and hit start. You now have a free 24/7 Minecraft server!!
