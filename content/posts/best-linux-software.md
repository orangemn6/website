# Best Linux Desktop Software Awards per Category for 2017!

hey! you do realize that this post is only written because i was bored to do anything else, right?

also i want to make super clear that on these awards, we ran a set of completely democratic procedures, with a fully transparent voting. and by “we” i mean “me”, and by “voting” i mean a single vote! “mine” 👐

i will try to cover some basic categories, but not everything! basically whatever comes on my mind as im typing that!

so..

## Best Linux Desktop Shell 2017 Award

Plasma from KDE! ..ha! not even close! **it’s GNOME**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*rzXHBEnOgzAP_mS_reVXRQ.png)

GNOME might be slow, GNOME might looks like shit, GNOME might have the most non-sense design ever, GNOME is missing the basics, **but!** it is most polished than anything else, it is most extensible than anything else, it has a good set of core tools/apps, and most importantly it has **the biggest community support than anything else**, and by far!

### Runner Up

elementary and deepin are two desktops that i also do like! i dont include Plasma only because of their awful workspaces. but lets be realistic here! where are you guys? all together, including every Linux desktop project, you dont even do the 1/3 of GNOME’s userbase! **..and there is a good reason for it!**

well, the actual reason is that Mark woke up a day, and he thought
> ..hmm, what shall i do today to upset Linux community? oh i got! i will drop Unity and i will use GNOME!

## Best Linux Desktop Web-Browser 2017 Award

Firefox did lots this year, both regarding speed, look, and extensions! but they missed one important thing! **the Google Accounts!**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*1s_UpBCEURyrwyFGI5c7Pw.png)

as long as my everything is stored in Google, and as long as i have Android, i find it impossible to switch my web-browser!

### Runner Up

Firefox ofc! but it doesn’t matter! second place, first looser :)

## Best Linux Desktop Music App 2017 Award

look! i dont want to use web-apps on a Linux Desktop Awards article, but to me **there is not even music without YouTube! **music was discovered in 2005, when YouTube was firstly launched!

### Runner Up

Lollypop obviously!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*1o3T_JdS_hu130IU8vkfgA.png)

first because it is amazing, and second because it fits to my first award, the GNOME Desktop!

## Best Linux Desktop Movies App 2017 Award

Stremio without any second thoughts!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*heCAK9vYu9TDLsJu4_AGRA.png)

it lately has some streaming issues with its torrent library, and the calendar misses shows (that are on Board however), but still there is nothing on my knowledge that can beat it!

### Runner Up

GNOME MPV! however i must confess that im really disappointed with the progress of this project! but still this is what i use for local videos ..speaking of which..

## Best Linux Desktop Torrent Client 2017 Award

before i was used to use Deluge, now im on Qbittorent and super happy!

![dont let the empty list to fool you! im torrenting more than i can watch!](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*mcNHVPs6zLXZ73jyzHEM4A.png)*dont let the empty list to fool you! im torrenting more than i can watch!*

features side i think there is nothing you wont find, the UI doesn’t look good, but it is very practical when you’re torrenting like pros, it hasn’t bugs, and it has very active development!

### Runner Up

nothing really, but if i have to say something i will just say Transmission ..which is awful anyway

meanwhile it is kinda hilarious but Windows 10 have better torrent clients than Linux Desktop ..for the phones!? [like Torrex!](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/torrex-pro-torrent-downloader/9wzdncrdsgkg)

## Best Linux Desktop Code Editor 2017 Award

VSCode all the way! features side is almost identical to Atom (with extensions), but it includes a cool integrated terminal, plus is so much faster!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*UUKFDKCFywCZ99Bj8CkYBw.png)

what i do not like that much is the settings page and the integrated extension store, but at least those aren’t something we spend lots of time

### Runner Up

Android Studio or QtCreator, depending what you do

## Best Linux Desktop Photos App 2017 Award

there is not a single app that i can vote! what i use, is a mix of GNOME Files, EOG, and if i need editing, it will be GIMP

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*KVkyv_QmU5ZJaW-3fvCVJw.png)

### Runner Up

as a runner up i will vote for GNOME Photos, although it sucks, but i do like the design, and the two bugs i have open (“Open With..” & Custom Locations) are not closed by the developer, so i assume they may fix them, somewhere in the distant future!

## Best Linux Desktop Tools 2017 Award

if Linux desktop isn’t miss something, those are the system tools! and here i could list so many! however everything begins from the terminal emulator and Tilix is simply the best there is!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*6VQhLSrutIXWWd_WPPfRzw.png)

Tilix can do almost everything [but this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xroL6ZWg2Gs) GOD DAMN YOU KDE :p

### Runner Up

well, a filemanager should be second, and that is GNOME Files! [it is not that i love it](https://medium.com/@alex285/in-gnome-3-28-files-remains-a-dumb-filemanager-66316e8c34f0), but i dont see a better option really

## Best Linux Desktop App Format 2017 Award

since i use GNOME, it is perfectly normal lots of my choices to inherit from that. so here the award goes to **Flatpak**, because all GNOME Apps are available on it

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*zLlLKUz6ghvNe8tcROmAqw.png)

Linux App Stores and in this particular case Flathub and GNOME Software dont follow, their development is sad really, without logins, payment systems, recommendations, proper ratings, app statistics, etc, but at least there is on-going effort for all those

### Runner Up

Snaps obviously! although to be honest the only formats i have are either Flatpaks or AppImages! ..but lets say Snaps to keep Alan Pope happy :p

## Best Linux Desktop Flatpak App 2017 Award

since i awarded Flatpak above, and since i just post random things that just come to my head, i made up this award and i will give it to Cuphead!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*A-lYEYyr7dlTK-Pr7JFFmg.png)

this isn’t about the game, but for the the [Flatpaking of WINE](https://youtu.be/Es2Jg0EK3sA) which is a bless!

### Runner Up

GNOME Builder! a Flatpak app, to create other Flatpak apps! cool!

## Best Linux Desktop Video Software 2017 Award

video editing is consisted of lots of tools! it is not that you can do much with a video editor, apart some screencasts i upload :)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*xpXweduUf9Vch-6G_5NPrw.png)

so i give the award in 5 programs, that you can use in-together

1. Kdenlive

1. GIMP

1. Blender

1. Audacity

1. Open Toonz

### Runner Up

goes on Blackmagic with Fusion and Resolve, together with Blender for the 3D. actually that would be my first award, but it doesn’t work properly on Linux yet. lets hope that Blackmagic will become more Linux tolerant in 2018!

## Best Linux Desktop Designer App 2017 Award

Gravit! simply awesome, although im waiting to see inVision too, which for start will release only for Windows 10 and macOS

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*fWEytLJuEawPG4NkPeR_Pw.png)

Gravit has great tools and good snapping, but what is greater is their cloud store! you just save your work online completely seamless, and you can access and continue work from everywhere!

### Runner Up

Inkscape i guess! although the scope of these two apps is completely different, plus Inkscape UI sucks impossible much! i mean Inkscape is really a reason to uninstall Linux, and go buy a Windows and and Illustrator license :)

## Best Linux Desktop Wallpapers 2017 Award

not bias at all! you will find the best on [my Flickr account](https://goo.gl/y8xhIy) :p

![the wallpapers app is [HydraPaper](https://github.com/GabMus/HydraPaper/releases/tag/1.2)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*2vvZx1zZdTJw5aFu2UikNQ.png)*the wallpapers app is [HydraPaper](https://github.com/GabMus/HydraPaper/releases/tag/1.2)*

carefully chosen wallpapers, with a large pool of topics ..but mostly anime!

### Runner Up

[Pixiv.Net](http://www.pixiv.net) ofc! altought it is very slow from Europe, and you have to pay to get access in all their services! but they really have great artists!

## Best Linux Desktop Office Suite 2017 Award

you wont find any Libre Office here! Office tools, Mails, Calendars, whatever such, i only run them exclusively on **Google Cloud Desktop!**

## Best Linux Desktop Distro 2017 Award

im fully towards Rolling Releases, like Arch or Solus, and im also fully on GNOME desktop. however im gonna give this award to **KDE NEON! **..that is even Ubuntu LTS based!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*GID5z2q9cK8Fbbp1d5SNcw.png)

the reason is because i believe these big desktop organizations like GNOME and KDE should launch their own and complete solutions, and try to get revenue, **because listen to alex**
> to be free, first you need to be rich

GNOME is not a free desktop, because they simply lack the freedom to create. there are lots of things they want to do, and GNOME Desktop would be much much better, but they lack the resources

### Runner Up

Arch or some Arch based system. not only because is rolling release, but also because of the community support and their Wiki. however i believe Arch wont be here for ever ..no money, no honey :)

well, that was all! probably i could continue, but i got bored! hope you enjoyed the reading ..although i doubt :)
