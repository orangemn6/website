# My new site

## Introduction
Remember my old site, with my orange theme and ugly font? Well, that is no more!! I have created a new site with a site generator called _hugo_. Hugo is like jekyll, but more customizable.

## Why?
Why did I choose to use hugo, over anything else? The first reason is that it is more customizable. The options are not limited to github pages rules. My second reason is that it has lots of themes, like this one. Hugo has a template system, so I can go to themes.gohugo.io and choose a theme, submodule it, and done!! THat is why I chose hugo over jekyll.

## Closing
Hugo may not be the right choice for everyone. You have to host it from your own computer, and setting it up is not simple. You may not have to run npm npm every time you want to edit it, but instead you have to build and rebuild and build and rebuild. So if you want to try hugo, it is FOSS.
