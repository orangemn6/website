**Warning:** This will wipe all data from device

**Getting an iso**

-step 1: 
download an iso of the distro. some user friendly distros i recommend for beginners are ubuntu, and linux lite.
once you get the iso file, it should be 1.0GB+ 

-step 2:
Burn the iso to a disk or usb drive. i use a tool called etcher. download it at https://etcher.io
once the iso is burned, put usb or disk in device and move on to your device instructions

**PC**

-step 1:
find the boot menu. on boot, when the dell or hp logo is showing, spam f2, f12, f7, or esc to enter the bios. Google which key it is. 

-step 1 alternative
in windows, go to the start menu go to power, and hold shift and click restart. click on boot from device, and select your usb drive.

**Warning:** This will delete all chrome os data

-step 1
enable developer mode.
hit esc+reload+power on the top row keyboard. it should say chromeos is missing or damaged. hit ctrl+d and a warning will come up. hit enter, wait five minutes, and you have developer mode.

-step 2
after you turn back on wifi, sign in as guest, go to mrchromebox.tech and use rw_legacy firmware.

**installing**

on the linux desktop there should be something that says install name of distro. double click that. choose whatever options you like in the installer and finish the installation. reboot and you have linux. 
{: .box-warning} Note:on chromebooks you have to press ctrl+l when it says os verification is off. to disable this, use mrchromebox full rom.
