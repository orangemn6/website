# Traits of Good and Bad Leaders

Successful businesses need leaders, someone who can inspire employees
and lead them, and the business towards success. Leaders
encourage others to work to their full potential, inspire creativity,
and aid motivation. During turbulent economic times, the need for good
leaders intensifies. Someone who presents a clear vision for recovery
leads by example and instills confidence in those around them. A good
leader has many traits, if you can recognize these within yourself and
capitalize on them, then you may become a successful leader in your work
environment. The global financial crisis has created chances for people
to rise to the forefront of businesses and lead in ways that were not
possible before.

Leaders who are regarded as ideal display some very prevalent traits:

1.  LISTEN- It is important to listen when it comes to leading. Listen
    to others, what they are saying about each other, and about you. You
    can learn an awful lot by listening. Information absorbed can help
    you examine your management style and gauge what others think of it
    and you.\
     
2.  ENTHUSIASM- A good leader is enthusiastic about their work or cause
    and also about their role as a leader. People will respond more
    openly to a person of passion and dedication. Leaders need to be
    able to be a source of inspiration and be a motivator towards the
    required action. Although the responsibilities and roles of a leader
    may be different, the leader needs to be seen to be part of the team
    working towards the goal. \
     
3.  OBSERVATION- Observe others and note their strengths and weaknesses,
    observe what they like to do and what they dislike. This way you can
    assign tasks that complement other people’s strengths and enable
    efficient teamwork.\
     
4.  COMMUNICATION- Effective communication will boost your leadership
    abilities. Be relatable and approachable, listening to those who
    come to you and encouraging communication among all employees\
     
5.  TRUST- Trust others and let their voices be heard. Allow others to
    participate in decisions, share leadership, and distribute tasks.
    This will boost morale and enforce employees worth in an
    organization\
     
6.  ADAPT- React to shifting circumstance accepting difference as a
    difference rather than as a problem. Adaptability and flexibility
    are key when it comes to being a good leader. While people will look
    to you to make decisive decisions, these need not come at the
    expense of flexibility and adaptability. 

7.  SELF AWARENESS- Somebody with good self-awareness, knows their own
    internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions therefore
    can recognize their own weaknesses and strengths\
     
8.  CLEAR VISION A leader with vision has a clear, vivid picture of
    where to go, as well as a firm grasp on what success looks like and
    how to achieve it. But it’s not enough to have a vision; leaders
    must also share it and act upon it. A leader must be able to
    communicate his or her vision in terms that cause followers to buy
    into it. He or she must communicate clearly and passionately, as
    passion is contagious

Other general traits include, but are not limited to; honesty,
fair-minded, imaginativeness, broad-minded, and competence. \
\
It is important to exhibit these traits. Simply possessing each trait is
not enough; you have to display it in a way that people notice. People
want to see you demonstrating these traits–not just assuming that you
have them. It isn’t enough to just be neutral. It has been said that the
only test of good leadership is that somebody follows. \
\
Good leaders are easy to spot. Bad leaders are easy to hide when times
are good; however, with the tightening of the markets, it has become
increasingly difficult to hide bad leaders. Bad leadership during
turbulent economic times is a recipe for disaster. \
\
Leaders who are regarded as less than ideal display some very prevalent
traits:

1.  LACK OF ENERGY- This lack of enthusiasm means that those in charge
    do not like new ideas or moving away from the norm. This creates
    difficulty for other employees to become passionate if they have not
    been led from the front by passion.\
     
2.  PESSIMISM- Often bad leaders are pessimistic and set low targets so
    they may be perceived as overachieving. These leaders are not open
    to challenges. Optimism and a willingness to embrace challenges can
    increase employee motivation and enthusiasm.\
     
3.  LACK OF CLEAR VISION- Poor leaders are often vague in their vision
    for success and are opposed to collaborating with others. Leaders
    must work with those around them and for those around them if they
    are to gain positive results. \
     
4.  LACK OF INTERPERSONAL SKILLS- This comes from a refusal to listen to
    others and to relate to others. This also often relates to a
    reluctance to use other people’s ideas and input. These leaders
    become separate to employees and employees can become disenchanted
    with their job and doubt their relevance to the business. \
     
5.  LACK OF COMMUNICATION- Not involving others in decisions and lack of
    communication can be detrimental to becoming a good leader. A good
    leader involves others in their decisions and actions. This boosts
    teamwork and employee motivation. Take John Schooland’s image of
    leadership as a guide. He states; ‘what kind of leader Are you going
    to be- the kind who thinks he is the best? Or will you be one of the
    very few greats who attribute success to the rest? 

These may seem like obvious traits that would negate good leadership
skills; however, these people are often unaware that they display such
traits. \
\
By consciously making an effort to exhibit the traits mentioned above,
people will be more likely to follow you. If you exhibit these traits on
a regular basis, you will be able to grow your influence to its
potential as a leader.
