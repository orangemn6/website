I have collected ten great repositories you can find on GitHub that will definitely give you an instant knowledge boost.

## 1. Awesome

Awesome is, without a doubt, the most popular repo that curates all topics from software development to hardware to business. It has more than 123,000 stars on Github at this moment, and one could spend days (nights) browsing it. It is my one-stop-shop if I want to learn something new.

## 2. List of (Advanced) JavaScript Questions

This repository (13,000 stars) created by Lydia Hallie (great person, by the way, check her out on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theavocoder)!) is awesome if you want to test your JavaScript knowledge and/or prepare for a job interview. Lydia constantly adds new questions, so this repo is growing steadily!

## 3. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

JavaScript Algorithms (59,500 stars) contains a tremendous amount of JavaScript-based examples of popular and less popular algorithms and data structures. The structure is really nice because the examples are labeled either beginner or advanced. So whether you are interested in cryptography, sorting, graphs or even machine learning (and much more), there will be something for you.

## 4. Clean Code JavaScript

Knowing how to write clean code is a useful skill for almost every developer and mandatory in many projects and corporations. This repository (28,400 Stars) takes the concepts of Clean Code by Robert C. Martin and adapts them for JavaScript so you can use them in future work.

## 9. Big List of Naughty Strings

You can invest as much as you want into testing your code and programs, but when real users come into play — believe me, they will do things you would have never thought of, especially when it comes to user input. This repository (34,100 stars) has a huge list of Strings that are known to be problematic when entered as input by the user. So whether you want to impress your QA friends or uses this for testing your software, this could be quite useful!

## 10. Awesome First PR Opportunities

The last repository I want to recommend to you is great if you want to get started with Open Source. Contributing to OSS is a great way to get involved with the community, add something to your portfolio, try out new things, become a better developer, and even find a new job. But getting started is quite hard, as I know from personal experience. This repository lists Open Source projects that are known for or currently have beginner-friendly issues that you can tackle. It helped me getting started with OSS, should help you as well!
