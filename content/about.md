# about me

I am a person who loves linux. I also love to help people learn more about programming and technology in general. I am currently working on a project called [opensuspect](https://github.com/opensuspect/opensuspect) with some other people. This website is built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io). I built this site as a learning place for developers and linux users of all kinds.

### Why you should use this site

I plan to have at least 100 posts by the end of 2020, so sit tight.
