### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I am a kid who loves anything with tech. I discovered linux :penguin: after playing around on my computers. I also like writing blog posts on my [website](https://jacobgoldstein.tk) every once in a while. I _**Love**_ playing Minecraft and Runescape, as well as other FOSS games. I would love if you checked out my website and commented! I am currently working on OpenSuspect, a FOSS mafia game.
