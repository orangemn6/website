      <description>All Marvel Cinematic Universe Movies Ranked With ‘Avengers: Endgame’ in theaters, how do the 22 films of the MCU stack up?
Eleven years and twenty-two films. It’s crazy to think about. When you look back at some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s early work, they look rather quaint compared to the epic *Avengers: Endgame*. The first film of the series, Iron Man (2008), was released to theaters when I was fifteen.</description>
