      <description>I just started ricing at the start of August 2019. So I made this list of things you might want to know when getting started with ricing your setup so that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t forget it easily.
Hopefully, it can be useful for you, too.
NOTE: The listed programs is mostly applied to Linux-based systems. You can look for some alternatives if you&amp;rsquo;re using anything else. Sorry, can&amp;rsquo;t help much with that.</description>

      <description>12 reasons why Linux is better than Windows The myth that Linux is complex and only needed by programmers and developers is not true.
Windows is the most popular operating system, and it is well deserved. She has come a long way, constantly improving and developing. However, although Microsoft claims that the Ten is its best creation, in some things Linux is far superior to Windows.
1. Convenient implementation of updates Perhaps we all know about this situation.</description>

      <title>The Fascinating Arch Linux Rice</title>

      <description>Recently, I dive into Linux the third time. The first time is in my childhood, I was attracted by the magazines, which introduced me the hacker culture. The second time was weird, I wanted to focus on study instead of PC gaming.
This time, it&amp;rsquo;s totally different. /r/unixporn and /r/MechanicalKeyboards attracted me. The most fascinating part of that is RICE or RICE culture.
RICE RICE is not the food rice. Instead, it is the acronym of Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancements.</description>

      <description>Everyone is always asking me, how do I rice linux so fast? And The answer is, I just have the some bash scripts set to keybinds. For the i3 window manager.
Script 1: Pywal So for this one you need pywal.
wal -i $HOME/Pictures/wallpapers -o wal-set Script 2: Sublime text theme This is a python script
#! /usr/bin/env python import json import os def make_element(name, scope, **kwargs): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;Helper function for generating color scheme entries&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; result = {} result[&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;] = name result[&amp;#39;scope&amp;#39;] = scope result.</description>

      <description>So when you first unzip the file, you will get an image file. it is an unprotected steganographed image. put it through steghide or stegosuite, and you will get instructions to make a GET request to https://www.jacobgoldstein.tk/happy/htb/index.html. once you do that you will get some base64 code. decode that and there is your flag!!</description>

      <title>Getting Started with i3wm</title>
      <link>https://www.jacobgoldstein.tk/posts/getting-started-with-i3wm/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jacobgoldstein.tk/posts/getting-started-with-i3wm/</guid>
      <description>Getting Started with i3wm My friends always get surprised when I show them how do I use i3. Unfortunately, the problem of using i3 is probably the same as in vi. You won’t be able to use alt+tab and everything is command-based, so by the end of the day, restart your computer to select an GUI will be easier, but I hope that after a few days (or maybe weeks) using it, you won’t want to use anything else.</description>

      <title>A Linux User&#39;s Thoughts on Macos</title>

      <description>A MacBook Pro isn&amp;rsquo;t a professional machine, and macOS isn&amp;rsquo;t impressive As a full-time Linux user, I have never cared much about Apple products. All of my previous computers were PCs that came with Microsoft Windows, which I invariably removed before putting Linux on it. Apple products are overpriced, and installing Linux on MacBooks is, in general, trickier than on an average PC, so I have looked away from MacBooks for years.</description>
