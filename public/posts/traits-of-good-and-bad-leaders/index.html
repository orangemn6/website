<p>Successful businesses need leaders, someone who can inspire employees
and lead them, and the business towards success. Leaders
encourage others to work to their full potential, inspire creativity,
and aid motivation. During turbulent economic times, the need for good
leaders intensifies. Someone who presents a clear vision for recovery
leads by example and instills confidence in those around them. A good
leader has many traits, if you can recognize these within yourself and
capitalize on them, then you may become a successful leader in your work
environment. The global financial crisis has created chances for people
to rise to the forefront of businesses and lead in ways that were not
possible before.</p>
<p>Leaders who are regarded as ideal display some very prevalent traits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>LISTEN- It is important to listen when it comes to leading. Listen
to others, what they are saying about each other, and about you. You
can learn an awful lot by listening. Information absorbed can help
you examine your management style and gauge what others think of it
and you.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ENTHUSIASM- A good leader is enthusiastic about their work or cause
and also about their role as a leader. People will respond more
openly to a person of passion and dedication. Leaders need to be
able to be a source of inspiration and be a motivator towards the
required action. Although the responsibilities and roles of a leader
may be different, the leader needs to be seen to be part of the team
working towards the goal. <br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OBSERVATION- Observe others and note their strengths and weaknesses,
observe what they like to do and what they dislike. This way you can
assign tasks that complement other people’s strengths and enable
efficient teamwork.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COMMUNICATION- Effective communication will boost your leadership
abilities. Be relatable and approachable, listening to those who
come to you and encouraging communication among all employees<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TRUST- Trust others and let their voices be heard. Allow others to
participate in decisions, share leadership, and distribute tasks.
This will boost morale and enforce employees worth in an
organization<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ADAPT- React to shifting circumstance accepting difference as a
difference rather than as a problem. Adaptability and flexibility
are key when it comes to being a good leader. While people will look
to you to make decisive decisions, these need not come at the
expense of flexibility and adaptability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SELF AWARENESS- Somebody with good self-awareness, knows their own
internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions therefore
can recognize their own weaknesses and strengths<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CLEAR VISION A leader with vision has a clear, vivid picture of
where to go, as well as a firm grasp on what success looks like and
how to achieve it. But it’s not enough to have a vision; leaders
must also share it and act upon it. A leader must be able to
communicate his or her vision in terms that cause followers to buy
into it. He or she must communicate clearly and passionately, as
passion is contagious</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Other general traits include, but are not limited to; honesty,
fair-minded, imaginativeness, broad-minded, and competence. <br>
<br>
It is important to exhibit these traits. Simply possessing each trait is
not enough; you have to display it in a way that people notice. People
want to see you demonstrating these traits–not just assuming that you
have them. It isn’t enough to just be neutral. It has been said that the
only test of good leadership is that somebody follows. <br>
<br>
Good leaders are easy to spot. Bad leaders are easy to hide when times
are good; however, with the tightening of the markets, it has become
increasingly difficult to hide bad leaders. Bad leadership during
turbulent economic times is a recipe for disaster. <br>
<br>
Leaders who are regarded as less than ideal display some very prevalent
traits:</p>
<ol>
<li>LACK OF ENERGY- This lack of enthusiasm means that those in charge
do not like new ideas or moving away from the norm. This creates
difficulty for other employees to become passionate if they have not
been led from the front by passion.<br>
 </li>
<li>PESSIMISM- Often bad leaders are pessimistic and set low targets so
they may be perceived as overachieving. These leaders are not open
to challenges. Optimism and a willingness to embrace challenges can
increase employee motivation and enthusiasm.<br>
 </li>
<li>LACK OF CLEAR VISION- Poor leaders are often vague in their vision
for success and are opposed to collaborating with others. Leaders
must work with those around them and for those around them if they
are to gain positive results. <br>
 </li>
<li>LACK OF INTERPERSONAL SKILLS- This comes from a refusal to listen to
others and to relate to others. This also often relates to a
reluctance to use other people’s ideas and input. These leaders
become separate to employees and employees can become disenchanted
with their job and doubt their relevance to the business. <br>
 </li>
<li>LACK OF COMMUNICATION- Not involving others in decisions and lack of
communication can be detrimental to becoming a good leader. A good
leader involves others in their decisions and actions. This boosts
teamwork and employee motivation. Take John Schooland’s image of
leadership as a guide. He states; ‘what kind of leader Are you going
to be- the kind who thinks he is the best? Or will you be one of the
very few greats who attribute success to the rest? </li>
</ol>
<p>These may seem like obvious traits that would negate good leadership
skills; however, these people are often unaware that they display such
traits. <br>
<br>
By consciously making an effort to exhibit the traits mentioned above,
people will be more likely to follow you. If you exhibit these traits on
a regular basis, you will be able to grow your influence to its
potential as a leader.</p>
