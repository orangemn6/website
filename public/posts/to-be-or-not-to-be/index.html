<p>Sometimes, people will question their actions. Sometimes people have 2 different identities: the one they keep to themselves, and the one that they share with others. This personality, this way of life, is common in lots of people. When you think something to yourself, and say something else. When you have a secret that you know can not be told. To Be or Not To Be, That is the Question. You can be your own self, and be free of worries. Or you can be 2 faced and keep things to yourself. Around people, I have seen my friends acting differently around their friends than their parents. This is an example of being 2-faced. This is not necessarily a bad thing though. Another quote I would like to share is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was born to make mistakes, not fake perfection -Drake</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote shows that people will always make mistakes. People try to fake perfection, while only they know what they know. In Taylor Swift&rsquo;s song Cardigan, she states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are young they assume you know nothing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My parents usually assume that they know more than me. I often have to play dumb whenever anyone brings something I am secretly good at in a conversation. I am being 2-minded in this situation here.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you understood this article. It was mostly so I could vent, but a lot of this is my psychological findings.</p>
