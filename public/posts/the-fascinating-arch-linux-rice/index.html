      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Recently, I dive into Linux the third time. The first time is in my
childhood, I was attracted by the magazines, which introduced me the
hacker culture. The second time was weird, I wanted to focus on study
instead of PC gaming.</p>
<p>This time, it&rsquo;s totally different.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">/r/unixporn</a> and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards">/r/MechanicalKeyboards</a>
attracted me. The most fascinating part of that is RICE or RICE culture.</p>
<h2 id="rice">RICE</h2>
<p>RICE is not the food rice. Instead, it is the acronym of Race Inspired
Cosmetic Enhancements. Let me look up in the dictionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parts put on cars to make them look fast, when they have no internal
tuning, and are actually slow as hell. ^<a href="#fn:1">1</a>{.footnote}^</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition is quite funny. It is exact the same behavior as we make
a great UI for dev and feel as if we get better efficiency.</p>
<p>Just as I remember, my first deep experience on RICE is in the MMORPG
game &ndash; World of Warcraft. WoW is an epic Blizzard game, with great
storyline and gaming experience.</p>
<p>Another fascinating part of WoW is the customizable user interface. For
WoW, it provides a simple UI, even lacking of basic functions on quests,
timers and so on. But its APIs are full pledged. Developers make lots of
WoW plugins. And gamers composite the plugins into their own user
interface. It&rsquo;s a typical RICE art and I like to watch FD (first down)
videos because of their great UI in different styles. And I spent a lot
of time compositing my own one.</p>
<p>My WoW Interfaces:</p>
<p><img src="https://crispgm.com/image/rice-wow-interface1.jpg" alt="my-wow-interface-1">
<img src="https://crispgm.com/image/rice-wow-interface2.jpg" alt="my-wow-interface-2"></p>
<h2 id="linux-rice">Linux RICE</h2>
<p>Mac/macOS are great hardware and software. But Apple seems never really
create the soil for RICE. Apple&rsquo;s idea is to create great product where
hardware and software are seamless and easy to use for normal users.
RICE has nothing to do with easy to use by its definition. And macOS has
long time been an authority software and closed ecosystem, so that we
can hardly make deep customization into system core.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s similar to Windows. RICE should only be great in the Linux
world.</p>
<p>Try Ubuntu?</p>
<p>Ubuntu may be the most popular Linux distribution. I was once an Ubuntu
user. It is a great distribution, which is maybe the first
beginner-friendly Linux distribution. It is a success to get big
population within developers and is pre-installed on some cheaper PCs.</p>
<p>But to some extent, it is a failure. For developers, they may use Linux
a lot but they may not actually use a Linux desktop. Most of them live
in Terminal or even access Linux remotely with SSH from either Windows
or macOS. The basic setup of IT companies is MacBook with real or
virtual Linux box. The desktop is just not friendly enough. For others,
it is simply hard to find Linux either user-friendly or productive. e.g.
The <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/linux-to-windows-10-why-did-munich-switch-and-why-does-it-matter/">LiMux
Project</a>.</p>
<p>For Unix/Linux RICE, I found ArchLinux and i3 are their major choices on
operating system, though Ubuntu sometimes be mentioned.</p>
<h3 id="arch-linux">Arch Linux</h3>
<p>When I was an early Linux enthusiastic, I heard about these main
distros. e.g. Redhat/Fedora, Debian, SUES, Slackware, Ubuntu, Gentoo,
and also Arch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> has the best home page (IMO)
and wiki of Linux distros in the world. The color scheme of its home
page win at its beginning.</p>
<p><img src="https://crispgm.com/image/rice-arch-linux-org.png" alt="arch-linux-org"></p>
<p>Arch Linux chooses blue as major color, which is vivid and shows the
sense of technology. I kept on copying the color scheme when I was
building my own home page. Even though today, I still feel it is a good
color scheme.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s head to Arch Linux&rsquo;s philosophy. I have no idea of these minimal
style distros since you can hardly handle shell/terminal from the
beginning. But as soon as I get <em>solid</em> skills on that, I appreciate its
idea: ^<a href="#fn:2">2</a>{.footnote}^</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance</li>
<li>Installed as a minimal base system, configured by the user upon
which their own ideal environment is assembled by installing only
what is required or desired for their unique purposes.</li>
<li>Pacman package manager</li>
<li>Rolling-release upgrades model</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as I read Arch&rsquo;s philosophy, I know that the second point is the
most important reason why it is popular in RICE culture. And Pacman
makes it even easier and powerful.</p>
<p>It is somehow like Gentoo Linux but seems to be a lot easier, because
the Gentoo packages and base system are built directly from source code
but Arch tends to make user build packages
quicker.^<a href="#fn:3">3</a>{.footnote}^</p>
<p>And finally, it is like you make your own system and are responsible for
yourself. You choose what you need and configure as you like based on
what you can do. No surprise, no weird parts, so it is totally in
control.</p>
<p>The Arch Linux Wiki is so good that I can easily follow the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide">Installation
guide</a> and it
is done.</p>
<p>It is super easy to install packages with Pacman. Everything is there
and Arch also has a repository (ArchLinux User Repository) for user
packages. For example, it is like a non-GUI operating system and we need
some more to setup a GUI system.</p>
<p>::: {.language-shell .highlighter-rouge}
::: {.highlight}</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.highlight}" data-lang="{.highlight}"># Login Manager
sudo pacman -s lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter
# X Window
sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-apps xorg-xinit
</code></pre><p>:::
:::</p>
<h3 id="i3">i3</h3>
<p>i3 is a popular tiling window manager. Tiling window manager? It&rsquo;s a
kind of window manager, where all windows lay on the desktop like tiles
or panes, and you just do not move windows by dragging title panel.
Instead, it&rsquo;s controlled by keys. You can easily move around and resize
the windows.</p>
<p>i3-gaps is an i3 fork, which is almost the same and adds more features
such as gaps between windows, that&rsquo;s why it is called i3-gaps.</p>
<p>::: {.highlighter-rouge}
::: {.highlight}</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.highlight}" data-lang="{.highlight}">sudo pacman -S i3-gaps
</code></pre><p>:::
:::</p>
<p>After installing X Window and i3-gaps, I got an empty desktop while I
can open a terminal with <code>Mod+Enter</code>{.highlighter-rouge}.</p>
<h3 id="alacritty">Alacritty</h3>
<p>To work with tiling window manager, we need a minimal style terminal. It
may not provide either multi-tabs support or multi-panes support.</p>
<p>urxvt, kitty, and st are common picks. I tried urxvt, which is actually
rxvt-unicode, but I have problems with Asian language displays.</p>
<p>Then I found that <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty">Alacritty</a> is the
right one for me. It is high-performance, GPU powered and easy
configuration.</p>
<p>::: {.highlighter-rouge}
::: {.highlight}</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.highlight}" data-lang="{.highlight}">sudo pacman -S alacritty
</code></pre><p>:::
:::</p>
<p><img src="https://crispgm.com/image/rice-alacritty.png" alt="alacritty"></p>
<h3 id="i3wm-themer">i3wm-themer</h3>
<p>For i3 starters, <a href="https://github.com/unix121/i3wm-themer">i3wm-themer</a>
should be mentioned. It is a CLI tool setups simple and minimalistic
desktop themes for you. It is best for newcomers to setup a basic theme
and have a panoramic and basic concepts on what composite a capable
desktop.</p>
<p>i3wm-themer integrates i3-gaps, Polybar, Nitrogen, Rofi, rxvt-unicode,
various fonts and others.</p>
<p><strong>Polybar</strong> is to help users create awesome status bars. It provides a
collection of modules. e.g. Text label, sound volume, Wi-Fi status, date
&amp; time, and etc.</p>
<p><strong>Rofi</strong> is an application launcher, a replacement of dmenu. dmenu is
the default one for X but Rofi seems to be more popular. And there are
also Alfred-like application launchers, but for most scenario, Rofi is
enough.</p>
<p><strong>Nitrogen</strong> is basically a background setter.</p>
<p>And as aforementioned, I replace rxvt-unicode with Alacritty.</p>
<p>Based on i3wm-themer, I have finally done my first Arch Linux RICE. All
configuration files of those parts are stored under
<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>{.highlighter-rouge}.</p>
<p><img src="https://crispgm.com/image/rice-screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot"></p>
<h3 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h3>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong> is a file manager and previewer with terminal interface, and
navigation is similar to Vim key bindings.</p>
<p><strong>vimiv</strong> may not be a well-known software but it worth a try. There are
a variety choices of image viewers and managers. vimiv is a Ranger but
for images. It is fast and works with GIF animations. A vim-style image
manager is so minimalistic.</p>
<p><strong>Firefox</strong> is a well-known browser. It is real free software and does
not compromise on privacy, comparing to Google. That&rsquo;s the reason why I
did not choose Chrome or Chromium.</p>
<h3 id="obstacles">Obstacles</h3>
<p>RICE on Arch Linux and maybe just Linux could be interesting but it also
has obstacles. There are common parts, however, every component actually
follows its own choice. e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bash or Zsh uses dot rc files</li>
<li>Most modern softwares use XDG directories</li>
<li>GUI apperances are configured under
<code>.Xresources</code>{.highlighter-rouge} or using GTK (or Qt) themes</li>
</ul>
<p>And to make things much more difficult, they have their own file
specifications.</p>
<p>I have to write Shell Script, JSON, XML, YAML, INI, and other private
configuration codes.</p>
<p>For tools like Vim, it&rsquo;s actually Vim Language and we have to learn a
lot to make it powerful together with plugins. Luckily, Vim
configuration is another topic that I have already handled before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the cost of freedom. We as users have the freedom to choose
everything and software programmers also have.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think RICE is the art of building things special for personal use and
habits, and with our own tastes and personalities. I know that not
everyone is interested or has the passion on RICE. Once I dived into
that, I have had a lot of happiness.</p>
