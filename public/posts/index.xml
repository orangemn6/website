            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="traits-of-good-and-bad-leaders">Traits of Good and Bad Leaders</h1>
<p>Successful businesses need leaders, someone who can inspire employees
and lead them, and the business towards success. Leaders
encourage others to work to their full potential, inspire creativity,
and aid motivation. During turbulent economic times, the need for good
leaders intensifies. Someone who presents a clear vision for recovery
leads by example and instills confidence in those around them. A good
leader has many traits, if you can recognize these within yourself and
capitalize on them, then you may become a successful leader in your work
environment. The global financial crisis has created chances for people
to rise to the forefront of businesses and lead in ways that were not
possible before.</p>
<p>Leaders who are regarded as ideal display some very prevalent traits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>LISTEN- It is important to listen when it comes to leading. Listen
to others, what they are saying about each other, and about you. You
can learn an awful lot by listening. Information absorbed can help
you examine your management style and gauge what others think of it
and you.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ENTHUSIASM- A good leader is enthusiastic about their work or cause
and also about their role as a leader. People will respond more
openly to a person of passion and dedication. Leaders need to be
able to be a source of inspiration and be a motivator towards the
required action. Although the responsibilities and roles of a leader
may be different, the leader needs to be seen to be part of the team
working towards the goal. <br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OBSERVATION- Observe others and note their strengths and weaknesses,
observe what they like to do and what they dislike. This way you can
assign tasks that complement other people’s strengths and enable
efficient teamwork.<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COMMUNICATION- Effective communication will boost your leadership
abilities. Be relatable and approachable, listening to those who
come to you and encouraging communication among all employees<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TRUST- Trust others and let their voices be heard. Allow others to
participate in decisions, share leadership, and distribute tasks.
This will boost morale and enforce employees worth in an
organization<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ADAPT- React to shifting circumstance accepting difference as a
difference rather than as a problem. Adaptability and flexibility
are key when it comes to being a good leader. While people will look
to you to make decisive decisions, these need not come at the
expense of flexibility and adaptability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SELF AWARENESS- Somebody with good self-awareness, knows their own
internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions therefore
can recognize their own weaknesses and strengths<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CLEAR VISION A leader with vision has a clear, vivid picture of
where to go, as well as a firm grasp on what success looks like and
how to achieve it. But it’s not enough to have a vision; leaders
must also share it and act upon it. A leader must be able to
communicate his or her vision in terms that cause followers to buy
into it. He or she must communicate clearly and passionately, as
passion is contagious</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Other general traits include, but are not limited to; honesty,
fair-minded, imaginativeness, broad-minded, and competence. <br>
<br>
It is important to exhibit these traits. Simply possessing each trait is
not enough; you have to display it in a way that people notice. People
want to see you demonstrating these traits–not just assuming that you
have them. It isn’t enough to just be neutral. It has been said that the
only test of good leadership is that somebody follows. <br>
<br>
Good leaders are easy to spot. Bad leaders are easy to hide when times
are good; however, with the tightening of the markets, it has become
increasingly difficult to hide bad leaders. Bad leadership during
turbulent economic times is a recipe for disaster. <br>
<br>
Leaders who are regarded as less than ideal display some very prevalent
traits:</p>
<ol>
<li>LACK OF ENERGY- This lack of enthusiasm means that those in charge
do not like new ideas or moving away from the norm. This creates
difficulty for other employees to become passionate if they have not
been led from the front by passion.<br>
 </li>
<li>PESSIMISM- Often bad leaders are pessimistic and set low targets so
they may be perceived as overachieving. These leaders are not open
to challenges. Optimism and a willingness to embrace challenges can
increase employee motivation and enthusiasm.<br>
 </li>
<li>LACK OF CLEAR VISION- Poor leaders are often vague in their vision
for success and are opposed to collaborating with others. Leaders
must work with those around them and for those around them if they
are to gain positive results. <br>
 </li>
<li>LACK OF INTERPERSONAL SKILLS- This comes from a refusal to listen to
others and to relate to others. This also often relates to a
reluctance to use other people’s ideas and input. These leaders
become separate to employees and employees can become disenchanted
with their job and doubt their relevance to the business. <br>
 </li>
<li>LACK OF COMMUNICATION- Not involving others in decisions and lack of
communication can be detrimental to becoming a good leader. A good
leader involves others in their decisions and actions. This boosts
teamwork and employee motivation. Take John Schooland’s image of
leadership as a guide. He states; ‘what kind of leader Are you going
to be- the kind who thinks he is the best? Or will you be one of the
very few greats who attribute success to the rest? </li>
</ol>
<p>These may seem like obvious traits that would negate good leadership
skills; however, these people are often unaware that they display such
traits. <br>
<br>
By consciously making an effort to exhibit the traits mentioned above,
people will be more likely to follow you. If you exhibit these traits on
a regular basis, you will be able to grow your influence to its
potential as a leader.</p>

            <description>All Marvel Cinematic Universe Movies Ranked With ‘Avengers: Endgame’ in theaters, how do the 22 films of the MCU stack up?
Eleven years and twenty-two films. It’s crazy to think about. When you look back at some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s early work, they look rather quaint compared to the epic *Avengers: Endgame*. The first film of the series, Iron Man (2008), was released to theaters when I was fifteen.</description>

<p>With ‘Avengers: Endgame’ in theaters, how do the 22 films of the MCU stack up?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*kOFjybVSWKIELLi1O36uag.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Eleven years and twenty-two films. It’s crazy to think about. When you look back at some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s early work, they look rather quaint compared to the epic <a href="https://medium.com/@thesamlenz/avengers-endgame-is-a-gargantuan-epic-review-7c9bf114c553?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ff23704d48683319c49d0b87d3160398">*Avengers: Endgame</a>*. The first film of the series, <em>Iron Man</em> (2008), was released to theaters when I was fifteen. I grew up with these movies, so it was exceptionally hard to sit down and rank them. I love them all — even the average ones. So, with a significant amount of difficulty:</p>
<h3 id="22-thor-the-dark-world-2013">22. Thor: The Dark World (2013)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*d7fbKj-eT3ebT-T2e41hHA.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The second installment of the Thor franchise, while a fun ride, is pretty forgettable. If there’s one thing this film gifted the MCU, it’s the creative overhaul of the Thor franchise, leading to the zany <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> (2017). Its muted color palette and uneven tone don’t do it any favors. Tom Hiddleston, as Loki, seems to be the only person in this movie having any actual fun; Chris Hemsworth seems bored as Thor. The villain, Malekith, is a bland, motive-less object for Thor to punch, and is played with all the charisma of wet cardboard by Christopher Eccleston. Neither the humor nor the emotional beats always land in this film, and our hero never learns or changes. Loki is the standout of this movie. If you’re a Loki fan, you’ll find some enjoyment in <em>The Dark World</em>.</p>
<h3 id="21-the-incredible-hulk-2008">21. The Incredible Hulk (2008)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*nLf_HFfFoXF4pPQA5_yOjg.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>While not without its merits, <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> still doesn’t quite get the big green guy right. Edward Norton is miscast as Bruce Banner, and the film seems to just be going through the motions. There is some style to the proceedings and some fun action set pieces. With the exception of William Hurt returning to the screen recently as Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, this movie has been forgotten by the larger MCU. It feels inessential, and would have been much better with Mark Ruffalo in the lead.</p>
<h3 id="20-iron-man-2-2010">20. Iron Man 2 (2010)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*OLmj6iruZxdPz9MB4Zj8iQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Kevin Feige was clearly still learning how to build a cinematic universe properly in <em>Iron Man 2</em>, and it shows. To be fair, he’s the first to have attempted one, so there wasn’t any road map to follow here. Robert Downey, Jr. was born to play Tony Stark/Iron Man, which is the biggest strength of the film. The action set pieces seem too random and separate from the plot, and the second act of the film drags as Tony creates a new element to fix his blood poisoning. All in all, it’s an entertaining if uneven movie that doesn’t hold a candle to the best Marvel has to offer. At least it introduced us to Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow.</p>
<h3 id="19-thor-2011">19. Thor (2011)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*pHElfpWP7zi-2DsfMtpzMA.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>*Thor *is one of those films that is a lot of fun to watch for the performances of Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as mythic brothers Thor and Loki. The fish-out-of-water storyline creates some great opportunity for comedy, but the boring location of a small, New Mexico town hinders the film. Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman have little in the way of chemistry and only spend a few days together, so the emotional payoff at the end doesn’t really land. Kenneth Branaugh is a fine director, he just doesn’t have the material to work with here.</p>
<h3 id="18-ant-man-and-the-wasp-2018">18. Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*Uz9AVTLvC-4Z8AoxIPF-4w.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is where the ranking starts getting really hard, because I truly enjoy the middle half of this list. <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em> was in a better position than its predecessor, as director Peyton Reed wasn’t coming into the production midway through. Therefore, the direction is a little more sturdy here. It also is the first movie (co-)lead by a female. Hope Van Dyne/Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) is a great character. It’s a laugh-a-minute comedy, with some creative visuals and great action, but there are a few problems with it.</p>
<p>For one, the movie is simply weightless. The villains are little more than a minor annoyance to our heroes, and don’t evoke any growth from them. Then, there’s Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). In the first film, Scott was a capable, smart, yet flawed man that Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) chose to take his mantle. Yet, here, Scott is written as an unintelligent loser. Big laughs are imminent, but at the cost of the character.</p>
<h3 id="17-ant-man-2015">17. Ant-Man (2015)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*FtmEuqPqwHKi3ksqgyyzlQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Both <em>Ant-Man</em> and it’s sequel have been released after Avengers films as small scale palette cleansers of sorts. For that purpose, they work well. Paul Rudd is great as Paul Rudd — I mean, Scott Lang, a criminal who, through the manipulation of Hank Pym takes on the Ant-Man mantle. It’s action-packed, funny, and heartfelt. The third act, taking place in a child’s bedroom, has some great visual gags and stylistic choices.</p>
<p>That being said, this is one of the biggest examples of the “Marvel formula” being evident. There are few risks being taken. It’s a great time and visually inventive, but predictable. It’s not a bad film, by any means, but it’s nothing spectacular either. I will note, however, that I saw it three times in the theater and the score by Christophe Beck is still my favorite in the MCU.</p>
<h3 id="16-spider-man-homecoming-2017">16. Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)</h3>

<p>There’s a lot to like about this movie. Tom Holland is most definitely the best live-action Peter Parker we’ve seen thus far, and his Spider-Man is on point as well. Tony Stark is a welcome presence as Peter’s mentor, and it’s refreshing to have a high school setting in a Spider-Man movie — a real one, not one populated by thirty-year-olds. In the end, this is an enjoyable movie, with an excellent villain in The Vulture (Michael Keaton). But it’s still a character that we’ve seen before. The MCU had the opportunity to do something truly different and introduce Miles Morales, the protagonist of the excellent *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse *(2018). After what Sony did with that film, it’s hard to see *Homecoming *as anything more than average.</p>

<p>This is another film that sticks woefully close to Marvel’s formula. It’s basically *Iron Man *with magic instead of technology. However, director Scott Derrickson deserves <em>major</em> props for creating a new visual style for Marvel, as well as spearheading the magical corner of this universe. Visually, this is one of the strongest MCU offerings. The casting is perfect, and Tilda Swinton is a standout as The Ancient One, Strange’s mentor in the magical arts. Now that the basic origin story is out of the way, I can’t wait to see what Marvel does next with this character.</p>
<h3 id="14-avengers-infinity-war-2018">14. Avengers: Infinity War (2018)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*wfvLN1Xv6BeJuTBSO2IMYQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>This may be seen as blasphemy, and I’m aware that I am in the minority of people that were lukewarm on <em>Infinity War</em>. There’s still a lot of good in this movie, though. The character groupings are inspired, my favorite of which is Thor, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot. The action is well done, and the scope is massive, especially the third act battle sequence in Wakanda. Thanos is a great character, and this is his movie. His the best villain Marvel has had so far (barely edging out Killmonger of <em>Black Panther</em>), and is brought to life by Josh Brolin. The visuals used in creating Thanos through motion capture are in top form.</p>
<p>My issues with this movie come with its disjointed and unfocused storytelling. At times, this movie feels like a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive narrative. I don’t fault the filmmakers; they had to pull off a massive balancing act here. It works more often than it doesn’t, but it’s definitely uneven. The tragic final minutes of the film also ring hollow; we as an audience know these events will be reversed in the next installment. There was no good way to pull off the ending of this movie, and I commend the Russo brothers for doing what was a best case scenario. *Infinity War *just felt like too much set-up, not enough movie.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*DlCqqGj4RSuR9YbbYeDjkw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The third movie in the Iron Man franchise is one of the most underrated films in the MCU. I’ll get this out of the way now: The Mandarin twist <em>works</em>, especially in the context of the film. The way *Iron Man 3 *moves Tony Stark forward is excellent, acknowledging the past but giving us glimpses into his future. He goes through real change in this movie, relying on his smarts to defeat both a physical villain and his own mental demons. Shane Black was a different voice in the MCU, and that rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.</p>
<p>Now, this film does have its faults. The way Tony just gets over his PTSD in a phone call with a child is an odd choice. His character arc is also undermined slightly by the third act, in which he relies on his suits to defeat the villain, but then comes to the conclusion he doesn’t need them. However, the positives of this movie far outweigh the negatives. Maybe give it a rewatch, *IM3 *haters.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*y51YppsV7hDCvDSosB6kPw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The final movie in Phase One, which introduced the world to Thanos through a post credit scene, was an event upon its arrival. Unprecedented, this movie brought all four superheroes together for a team up that hadn’t been seen before. For that, it should be commended. It’s <em>a lot</em> of fun. Seeing these characters bicker with each other before teaming up to kick some alien ass is a good time. The third act of this movie is a comic book fan’s dream.</p>
<p>Loki is back as the villain, and as usual, Tom Hiddleston seems to be having a blast with the character. If only his plot wasn’t so nonsensical. He wanted to defeat the Avengers by…*assembling *them? He wanted to bring <em>someone else’s</em> army to Earth so *he *could rule it? Man, that trip through the wormhole must have really damaged his common sense. It’s a fun movie to watch from time to time, but it’s not the strongest Marvel has to offer.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*F68Yuh75XIK_GQXMM264SQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>After a severely lackluster marketing campaign, *Captain Marvel *proved to be a solid entry in the MCU. Brie Larson does exceptional work as Carol Danvers, and the supporting cast surrounding her imbues the movie with a lot of fun. The standouts are Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury (with glorious de-aging effects), Ben Mendelsohn as Talos, and of course, Goose the Cat. They all seem to be having a blast, especially Mendelsohn, who gets to *finally *break the typecasting he’s been subjected to recently. The 90s setting also allows for some fun cameos and pop culture references, as well as a killer selection of rock and pop songs from the era. I’ll be fair, a 90s set space adventure/buddy cop movie featuring Samuel L. Jackson and a cute cat is practically tailor-made for me.</p>
<h3 id="10-avengers-age-of-ultron-2015">10. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*cEurCG88KepAQM8PZQwrkQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another underrated film in the MCU, <em>Age of Ultron</em> actually surpasses its predecessor in many ways. Director Joss Whedon balances the quieter character moments and the bombastic action sequences with more grace than he did in <em>The Avengers</em>, and the result is a film that gives its characters real growth. This film has some <em>major</em> repercussions for the MCU. It informs both Tony Stark and Steve Rogers’ arcs going forward, and lays groundwork that is built upon in many later installments. Whedon clearly doesn’t know what to do with Thor here, but that’s about it for my major gripes.</p>
<p>Ultron is a great villain, not despite, but because of his childish behavior. He’s the bratty teenager insistent on burning the world down just to spite Tony Stark, his “father.” James Spader, though motion capture and voice work, makes Ultron a memorable villain. The new additions to the team are all welcome, and the third act stakes are *literally *sky high. <em>Age of Ultron</em> is a movie I’ve revisited multiple times, and it always retains its entertainment value.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*j6g9NcIQmtZ8MuGm4l1jZw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The movie that started it all is still one of Marvel’s best offerings. It introduced the world to Robert Downey Jr.’s iconic performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and set a new template not just for Marvel movies, but superhero movies in general. Jon Favreau’s assured direction gives the movie a classic feel, even with dated references to things like MySpace. Producer Kevin Feige took a gamble with this movie, and it payed off tenfold. Even with its flaws and dated elements, this is one of, if not *the *most influential blockbuster of the last two decades. There’s much more I could say about it, but that about sums it up.</p>
<h3 id="8-captain-america-civil-war-2016">8. Captain America: Civil War (2016)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*qRfmq0jZ9jDMH6JPu9jVjw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are some who argue that <em>Civil War</em> is more of an Avengers movie than a Captain America solo outing. Yet, Captain America is a captain, a leader, and this movie shows him undoubtedly in that element. There <em>are</em> a lot of characters, but Cap is at the forefront of it all. <em>Civil War</em> pays off the tension between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark that was first hinted upon in <em>The Avengers</em>, and it does it to tremendous effect. They are split in their political and ideological differences, neither of them completely right or wrong. This affords the film a nuance not seen in many Marvel films.</p>
<p><em>Civil War</em> is a great Steve Rogers movie, and its ending has real ramifications. Some could say that the airport brawl not resulting in anyone’s death was a mistake, but in what world would the team be able to bounce back from that? A death would have been a major miscalculation, and the filmmakers were smart enough to know that. Once again, the villain of the movie has an unnecessarily complicated plan, but everything is pulled off with such aplomb that it’s hard to take real issue with any of the plot contrivances.</p>
<h3 id="7-black-panther-2018">7. Black Panther (2018)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*v93MzbL2Oyh1sWkJV5sbtA.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>While this movie may not be my personal favorite in the MCU, it deserved its Best Picture nomination. <em>Black Panther</em> was a cultural milestone, and one of the biggest movies of the year. It was a huge step forward for diversity both in front of and behind the camera, and was an entertaining and emotional story to boot. Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is one of the best villains in the MCU, bringing a real ethos to the proceedings and challenging T’Challa’s (Chadwick Boseman) perspectives.</p>
<p>What separates <em>Black Panther</em> from the rest of the Marvel films, besides its cast and crew, is its message. Director Ryan Coogler uses Marvel’s resources to tell a personal story that reflects our society and the injustices people face today. The third act has some shoddy visuals, more in line with a video game than a blockbuster film, but the emotional backbone is strong enough to hold the movie up. A smash with audiences and critics alike, a return to Wakanda is greatly anticipated.</p>
<h3 id="6-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014">6. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*DUQfu7X5Ly0p1iUidIAFcA.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Who would have known that provocateur filmmaker James Gunn would have taken one of Marvel’s most obscure and offbeat properties and turned it into one of their flagship franchises? <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> is a rousing, heartfelt, and funny film, and Gunn is the perfect choice to be behind the camera. A rag tag team of criminals which includes a talking raccoon and a sentient tree that can only speak one sentence shouldn’t work cinematically. Yet, it does, and to great effect.</p>
<p>Set to a bitchin’ soundtrack of classic rock and pop, *Guardians of the Galaxy *is a fast paced, crowd pleasing blockbuster with unique characters that will steal your heart, and if you’re not careful, your wallet. This film was a turning point for Marvel, fully branching out into the cosmic universe after the Thor films merely dabbled in it. It can be a tear jerker, especially in the third act, but it is undoubtedly fun — even if it doesn’t *quite *capitalize on its villain.</p>
<h3 id="5-thor-ragnarok-2017">5. Thor: Ragnarok (2017)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*XFNlS7xUNwGHt9H0RLsqhQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>After two lackluster movies, Marvel did an overhaul of Thor’s character and hired Taika Waititi to direct the third installment. The resulting film not only gives the Thor franchise a “most improved” award, but is one of Marvel’s best offerings. A zany, hilarious, candy-colored space adventure featuring Mark Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner/Hulk, *Thor: Ragnarok *takes everything previously established in the Thor movies and tosses it out the window in the first twenty minutes. Then, it has a hell of a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Chris Hemsworth finally feels comfortable in the character, not losing the regal elements when they’re needed, but also getting to let his hair down (or chop it off entirely). He is surrounded by one of Marvel’s best supporting casts, including Cate Blanchett (Hela), Tessa Thompson (Valkyrie), Karl Urban (Skurge), and cinematic treasure Jeff Goldblum (The Grandmaster). Memorable set pieces abound, and while the film loses some emotional gravitas among the spectacle and humor, it stands out among the rest of the MCU as something truly special.</p>
<h3 id="4-captain-america-the-winter-soldier-2014">4. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*v9fd7KV7TPW-ghfMjjFPzA.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you haven’t figured it out yet, I really like the Captain America series. He’s my favorite comic book character, and Chris Evans is the perfect actor to embody Steve Rogers. He gets a true chance to shine in <em>The Winter Soldier</em>, a film that was Marvel’s first big step away from their formula, and the first sequel that expanded the hero’s journey in a meaningful way. Set in modern times, <em>Winter Soldier</em> explores Steve Rogers finding his place in a world that has moved on without him.</p>
<p>This is the Russo Brothers’ first collaboration with Marvel Studios, and its no wonder that Kevin Feige handed them the golden key to the Avengers mansion. What they do here is tremendous, staging fantastic action sequences, but never taking their eyes off of what matters: the characters. Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow) have incredible chemistry, and their friendship sells this movie. Then again, Anthony Mackie (Sam Wilson/Falcon) and Chris Evans have great chemistry too. Maybe Chris Evans just has great chemistry with everybody. Regardless, <em>The Winter Soldier</em> is top tier Marvel.</p>
<h3 id="3-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-2017">3. Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 (2017)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*pGGbyoqc6MHBIx9iAEIBBQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>While most sequels go bigger and bolder, James Gunn takes the Guardians of the Galaxy and thrusts them into a small, intimate story that explores familial relationships. <em>Vol. 2</em> takes everything that worked in the first film, and expands upon it, doubling down on the humor, the colorful sets, and the emotional journey of its central “family.” Gunn made the decision to set his sequel shortly after the events of the first Guardians film, thus creating a movie about how they grew together. The resulting film is simply wonderful.</p>
<p>The MVP of *Vol. 2 *is Yondu (Michael Rooker), Peter Quill’s (Chris Pratt) mentor and the man who raised him. Revelations are made about Yondu that give the daring and beautiful third act a <em>huge</em> emotional payoff. It is one of the most emotionally resonant films in the MCU, and its clear that Gunn has a deep love for these characters. I am so happy that he’ll be back for <em>Vol. 3</em>.</p>
<h3 id="2-captain-america-the-first-avenger-2011">2. Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*sD7rBxj5TCznJuTnA6Zzbg.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Until very recently, *The First Avenger *would have been number one on this list. I have always loved Captain America. As a small person, I always related to Steve Rogers wanting to do more but being told he couldn’t, until the day he could. He’s good for the sake of good, and the very definition of a hero. The biggest super power Steve Rogers has isn’t his immense strength, but his heart of gold. Joe Johnston’s movie exhibits this perfectly.</p>
<p>There are those who hate that Captain America takes down most of Hydra’s bases in the course of a montage, and I can understand that. But what’s important in this movie isn’t the action — its the character of Steve Rogers. The filmmakers develop his relationships with his fellow soldiers, his love interest, and his friends, only to pull the rug out from under him in the gut-wrenching final minutes of the film. It’s a beautiful ending, and one that has put a great character arc for Steve into motion. I’ve been waiting for eight years to see the payoff, which is why the next film takes the top spot in my ranking:</p>
<h2 id="1-avengers-endgame-2019">1. Avengers: Endgame (2019)</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*IUMyCP9s_fxwJqZuObR3nw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>What is there to say about this movie except: wow. I won’t spoil anything here, I promise. All I will tell you is that <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> wraps up the Infinity Saga, and specifically the arcs of Captain America and Iron Man perfectly. I couldn’t have asked for a better film. It’s light on action for the first two acts, only because it’s so focused on its characters. Steve Rogers <em>finally</em> gets the love he deserves in an Avengers movie, and it is spectacular.</p>
<p><em>Endgame</em> is emotionally overwhelming, a great culmination of 22 films. It’s a definitive end, unlike anything Marvel has done before before. Any faults I could nitpick about are minor compared to what this movie does in terms of its characters. The Russos have created the *essential *Marvel movie. I can’t wait to revisit this one.</p>

It’s no spoiler to reveal that in Avengers: Endgame, the good guys end up defeating the bad guys. That’s just how superhero stories work — at least in the second half of a two-part film series. But the Avengers don’t seem to realize that they’ve created many more problems in the process.</description>

<p>It’s no spoiler to reveal that in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, the good guys end up defeating the bad guys. That’s just how superhero stories work — at least in the second half of a two-part film series. But the Avengers don’t seem to realize that they’ve created many more problems in the process. The end result: The Earth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is still totally screwed.</p>
<p><strong>(Major spoilers for <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> follow. But come on — you’ve already seen it.)</strong></p>
<p>Oh, those Avengers. Both individually and together, they’ve saved the planet many times over. Sure, sometimes they accidentally create <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Avengers:_Age_of_Ultron">a robot that freaks out and decides the best way to protect Earth is by destroying humanity</a>, which is, admittedly, not technically incorrect — but the Avengers mean well!</p>
<p>After Thanos wiped out half the life in the universe during <em>Infinity War</em>, the Avengers finally have a chance to live up to their name and actually, you know, avenge something in <em>Endgame</em>. Unfortunately, it takes them five full years to do so — five years during which the remaining population of Earth is forced to live with the loss of countless loved ones, in a world where every aspect of civilization is suddenly half-staffed. <em>Endgame</em> doesn’t really linger on the horrifying effects this must have had, emotionally and socially, other than to briefly show how many people still can’t cope with their losses, and how the survivors have tried to consolidate their lives in a much emptier world than the one they used to live in.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="literally-every-single-person-who-disappeared-would-have-lost-their-jobs-as-companies-industries-consumers-and-profits-adjusted-to-the-new-normal">Literally every single person who disappeared would have lost their jobs as companies, industries, consumers, and profits adjusted to the new normal.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense, because it’s pretty dark stuff. So when the Avengers manage to figure out how to travel through time, you’d probably expect them — I certainly expected them — to prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers at all, erasing the half-decade of suffering and chaos from ever happening. Nope. Because of the very specific time travel rules <em>Endgame</em> establishes (which are dodgy!) the Avengers can only bring back those who were killed to their new present. Which they do, and herein lies the problem.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no way <a href="http://www.sociologydiscussion.com/demography/population-growth/12-main-consequences-of-population-growth/3162">the Earth could handle its population suddenly doubling</a>. Food production would have most likely been halved since the snap, meaning the returning 3.5 billion people would have very little to eat, for months at minimum — although it’s not like they’d be able to afford to buy food. Literally, every single person who disappeared would have lost their jobs as companies, industries, consumers, and profits adjusted to the new normal. In the instant of the Great Unsnap, the world’s unemployment jumped to around 50%. The global economy would likely collapse entirely.</p>
<p>To be fair, resurrecting half the universe didn’t technically make the Avengers responsible for making sure these people were fed and sheltered. So let’s turn to a massive problem that is entirely of their own making: Time. As I mentioned above, almost no time travel movie has rules that make sense, although <em>Endgame</em> sure goes out of its way when Tilda Swinton’s Ancient One and Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk establish the importance of not altering the past, so alternate timelines are not created. The Hulk explains that by borrowing the Infinity Stones in the past and returning them to the same minute they were taken, assuming no one notices, nothing in their timeline will have actually changed. Of course, this also assumes that the Avengers don’t screw things up.</p>
<p>Boy, do the Avengers screw things up. They mess with the timeline so much, in fact, it’s almost comical — to the point that it’s genuinely baffling that the movie pretended there were rules at all. The big alteration, of course, is that when present-day Nebula returns to 2014 to steal the Power Stone (just before the events of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>), it turns out she shares the same Wi-Fi network as 2014 Nebula, allowing 2014 Thanos to discover the Avengers’ plan and hitch a ride to the present, using the Avengers’ time machine. The end result is that the Avengers win when Tony Stark unsnaps this younger Thanos and his minions out of existence.</p>
<p>You don’t need to be Stephen Hawking to figure out the problems of the Avengers killing the Thanos of five years earlier — before he managed to get his big purple hands on the Infinity Stones at all. It means, of course, that the first Snap never happened at all, because Thanos died before he could do it. So no one ever died at all! This actually sounds great, except this impossible act has definitely created one or more timelines, which is a huge no-no.</p>
<p>That’s the big time travel problem, but there are plenty more. By bringing Gamora and Nebula from 2014 to the present, the events of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> movie didn’t happen. Surely a major Hydra agent believing Captain America was also a Hydra spy for the two years between the first <em>Avengers</em> movie and <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em> would have changed many things, perhaps even leading to the discovery of Hydra’s infiltration of SHIELD a lot sooner. Even Captain America’s decision to return to the 1940s, and live the rest of his life from there, would make changes to the timeline — and even <em>Endgame</em> directors, the Russo brothers, don’t seem to know how Cap returned to the prime timeline! And then there was one other small change: There’s a new Loki on the loose with a new Cosmic Cube.</p>
<p>We don’t even need to worry about how Loki’s freedom would affect the events of the second and third <em>Thor</em> movies, because now the trickster god has his own Infinity Stone, thanks to Captain America, Ant-Man, and Iron Man totally flubbing their mission to steal it when they travel to 2012 and the events of the first <em>Avengers</em> film. During some straight-up nonsense, <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Stone">the Cube — aka the Tesseract aka the Space Stone</a> — gets knocked to the feet of the handcuffed Loki, who grabs it and disappears.</p>
<p>The Space Stone allows its bearer to teleport anywhere across the universe or to warp space itself, which essentially allows telekinesis on a major level. Hey, remember in <em>Infinity War</em> when Thanos threw a damn moon at Iron Man? That was the Space Stone’s doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="by-bumbling-through-the-pasts-of-their-previous-film-the-avengers-are-screwing-things-up-very-very-badly">By bumbling through the pasts of their previous film, the Avengers are screwing things up very, very badly.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>So Loki, who was already a major pain in the ass when he only had his illusion powers, now has an Infinity Stone. Remember, this Loki hasn’t yet had the pangs of conscience that inspired him to be slightly heroic during <em>Thor: The Dark World</em> and <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>. The consequences for Earth, Asgard, and the universe could be — and surely would be — staggering.</p>
<p>I know all this is nitpicking, but Marvel’s decisions here are weird as hell. All the time travel nonsense would have actually been completely fine if <em>Endgame</em> hadn’t stressed how any alterations of the past would create new timelines, and that this was an unequivocally bad thing. Then, all the time travel shenanigans could have been hand-waved away, like in every other time travel movie. Instead, audiences are forced to recognize that by bumbling through the pasts of their previous film, the Avengers are screwing things up very, very badly.</p>
<p>But even this bizarre choice pales in comparison to keep that five-year gap. Sure, the fact that the surviving part of the world has had to live in a nightmare for half a decade certainly highlights the pathos of the Avengers living with their failure — but making it a canonical part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s continuity is stark raving mad. Half the planet has been deeply traumatized for a five full years! Many characters are suddenly five years older than their supporting casts! Even if everyone just gets over it off-screen, any future stories Marvel tells will need to account for this to some degree. (For instance, what will Wakanda look like in <em>Black Panther 2</em> when their king has been MIA for so long?) It’s such a weird decision, and so unnecessary — especially when the Avengers ended up having zero problems wrecking the timeline in countless other ways. Why not have them erase the Snap as well?</p>
<p>If you’re wondering how this could be done, let me introduce you to the greatest, most powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina">deus ex machina</a> in any universe: <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Gauntlet">The Infinity Gauntlet</a>. It’s all the plot justification the movie needs to do anything, really. If it’s powerful enough to rewrite reality so half of all living beings in the entire universe can be subtracted from or added back, it can do or undo anything the story needs or wants. If nothing else, I can assure you it’s not just for genocidal finger snaps.</p>
<p>The bright side is that all these plot holes don’t make <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> a bad movie. In fact, it’s pretty difficult to even notice these issues when you’re watching practically everyone in the 22 films that make up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films#%22The_Infinity_Saga%22">Marvel’s “Infinity Saga”</a> stop by to kick ass in the movie’s beyond-epic final act. I’m certainly not telling anyone to not go see it, in part because the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=marvel2019.htm">box office numbers</a> indicate you already have, and in part because it’s a genuine, uh… marvel. It’s just that with a few extremely easy plot alterations, the Avengers could have saved the universe better.</p>

            <description>The XY Files: The Lost Plot of Pokemon’s 6th Generation Scrapped, Leaked, Posted and Forgotten
Game Freak and The Pokemon Company have always been very secretive. Alpha and Beta builds of their games are almost mythic in rarity, and we so rarely get to see early or scrapped Pokemon designs. Everything remains in the vault, even the garbage.
This secrecy has engendered a history of speculation regarding upcoming games and Pokemon designs.</description>

<p>Scrapped, Leaked, Posted and Forgotten</p>

<p>Game Freak and The Pokemon Company have always been very secretive. Alpha and Beta builds of their games are almost mythic in rarity, and we so rarely get to see early or scrapped Pokemon designs. Everything remains in the vault, even the garbage.</p>
<p>This secrecy has engendered a history of speculation regarding upcoming games and Pokemon designs. It didn’t help that the franchise was born along with early widespread internet; rumours of Pikablu and Pokegods ran rampant on schoolyards during the heyday of Pokemania.</p>
<p>In recent years however, things have been… especially leaky.</p>
<p>Partly, this new wave of leaks is a problem of Game Freak’s own doing. In the transition from 2D to 3D games, the studio’s hodgepodge packing of data allowed for some unintentional information getting out there.</p>
<p>Notoriously, the free demo versions of <em>Pokemon Omega Ruby</em> and <em>Alpha Sapphire</em> and* Sun* and *Moon *versions contained massive amounts of superfluous data. Once hackers like <a href="https://twitter.com/Kaphotics">Kaphotics</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sciresm?lang=en">SciresM</a> cracked them open, data involving dialogue, plot, models, and the entire Pokedex could be pulled from just the demo.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once the games were released, information could be datamined that either wasn’t implemented, or not yet announced. Heartbreakingly, *Sun *and <em>Moon</em> contained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Sq4bP3-P0">walking and running animations</a> for every single Pokemon, suggesting that the much loved overworld walking partner mechanic (not seen since 2009) was scrapped very late on in development.</p>
<p>Thankfully the mechanic made a triumphant return in <em>Let’s Go Eevee</em> and <em>Let’s Go Pikachu</em>, and were likely not included in the “Ultra” iterations of Sun and Ultra Moon to push the wow factor of the first Switch titles.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*bIszkRN68N6MNvnDPmvOJg.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On top of everything, plain old anonymity allows people to safely distribute forbidden knowledge. With something like the global Pokemon franchise, there are so many moving parts that it’s reasonably impossible to keep everything under wraps. The final evolutions of the starter Pokemon from Sun and Moon (Incineroar, Primarina and Dicidueye) were leaked months prior in an animation style guide.</p>
<p>Truly, we are on the cutting edge of Pokemon <em>Espeon</em>age. With so much information, it can be difficult to tell what’s fabricated nonsense and what’s a legitimate peek. But as the following example illustrates posted by Twitter user Nibelion sometimes the Real Ones™ slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>So, if you would, travel back in time with me. We are going to visit the dangerous chronoscape of 2014, to see a very specific, mostly forgotten post on 4chan’s “/vp/” image board regarding the weird development of <em>Pokemon X</em> and <em>Pokemon Y</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a weird one, but it’s stuck with me for years now — mostly because almost everything this post suggests has been realized in some regard by Gamefreak’s later works. After seeing the April fool’s <em>Let’s Go Pikachu</em> leak retroactively proven true, I felt this old post needed to see the light of day. It needed justice.</p>
<p>Like I said before, the studio never throws out their garbage — it just stays in the vault.</p>
<p>So let’s dig into the garbage:</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-the-xy-files">Welcome to the XY Files</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*7U2S6er5IWab-kV3KHqdtg.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>In 2013 the hype cycle for Pokemon X and Pokemon Y was in full swing. And with good reason: the first ambitious jump into full 3D was truly a watershed moment for the franchise, and speculation ran wild as to what surprises were on the horizon. After all, Mega Evolution was announced — a feature that brought to mind the heady Grade 3 afternoons of trying (unsuccessfully) to ascend your Charizard into <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9Gods">godhood</a>.</p>
<p><em>Anything could happen.</em></p>
<p>Alleged leak posts of the time usually promised insider information on future implementations and titles. However, this post stood out. It was unusual.</p>
<p>Written by a contributor who went by “XYSider”, it was a description of cut content and various scrapped ideas that never made in into the release of <em>Pokemon X</em> &amp; <em>Pokemon Y</em>. In a few months, the long awaited 3DS remakes of Pokemon *Ruby *and *Sapphire *would be announced, but this post made no claim to predict anything upcoming.</p>
<p>In terms of credibility, they didn’t have much reason for people to believe the content: “I have no actual proof this is real since they cannot release prototype sketches, but the sources are from people I’ve been in contact with who worked on XY, mainly ones that did lesser work, at various points in production” What followed was “…a culmination of the various cut elements I’ve learned about.” In due fairness providing proof for content that wasn’t made is clearly ridiculous. At face value, at least.</p>
<p>So, going on faith and piqued interest, XYSider claimed that what they were posting was “planned content and elements for Pokemon X and Y..that were cut due to time constraints, or dropped for other reasons”, mostly pertaining to “plot elements, and original character designs, that never materialized and probably will never resurface in future instalments”.</p>
<p>Here’s the kicker: the elements XYSider claimed to leak absolutely did resurface in future instalments. With scary accuracy.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PmWmBx52d0Y3bMu8kfBW_Q.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="the-scrapped-plot"><strong>The Scrapped Plot</strong></h2>
<p>The main topic of the posted information was the initial vision for the plot of Pokemon X and Y. According to XYSider, the instalments were initially meant to have a very X-Filesian “paranormal bent”. This was in stark contrast to the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y#Plot">the finished plot </a>— which could be described as sparse dressing on the standard Pokemon fare.</p>
<p>You met a few friends, encountered some baddies, beat the baddies when they wanted to blow up the world with an ancient crystalline Nuclear Bomb metaphor, all the while getting badges and eventually beating the Elite Four, becoming Champion.</p>
<p>At the end (spoilers) “AZ”, an inexplicably massive old man who invented the not-Nuclear Bomb congratulates you at your award ceremony, and a Pokemon (that he initially invented the not-Nuke to resurrect) returned on good terms. All is forgiven.</p>
<p><em>Fin.</em></p>
<p><strong>How It Was Supposed To Go</strong></p>
<p>In the initial story plan, the game’s evil organization of Team Flare was an ersatz Men-In-Black. They consisted of aliens posing as humans with aims to destroy the planet. Their mission? Hunt down AZ, a fellow alien who had crash landed on Earth long ago. The giant, wandering wiseman AZ was meant to destroy Earth and its warring inhabitants, but had a change of heart and defected upon meeting a <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Floette_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Floette</a>. Unlike the final produced story, AZ would have Floette as a partner throughout, but his Floette’s flower would be the key to a doomsday weapon.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*uC-SuIsb4scekzEImKMckg.png" alt=""></p>
<p>AZ’s unique Floette was never distributed, but it could still be found in the game’s code, with special stats and even a special attack in Light of Ruin, which doesn’t sound important at all.</p>
<p>This prototype timeline could have given the unique Floette more plot importance — in the finished story, the key to the ultimate weapon was, well… just a set of plain looking key around AZ’s neck.</p>
<p>The Team Flare that we got was an evil organization that planned “to make the world better and more beautiful.” (???) Out of any context, X and Y failed to deliver any readable motive for Team Flare — even their name didn’t really line up with their goals.</p>
<p>Yet, we see footprints of their original mission. This <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Team_Flare#Trivia">little bit of trivia</a> from Pokemon wiki Bulbapedia.com tells it all: “The names of Team Flare’s scientists are possibly a reference to solar flares, which are classified as A, B, C, M, or X according to their peak flux range. Those are the scientists’ initials in each localization of the games.”</p>
<p>It’s almost as if the initial context was <em>supposed</em> to be extraterrestrial.</p>
<p>Regarding the “Ultimate Weapon” that becomes the climactic terror of the X and Y storyline, the box legendaries Xerneas and Yveltal were slated to be far more intrinsic to the threat. “(Xerneas and Yveltal were)…alien lifeforms initially, and were basically living superweapons, as opposed to being the power-source for the weapon like in the final version.”</p>
<p>It didn’t end there. Many other characters and Pokemon received haphazard changes to their design after the plot moved away from the paranormal and extraterrestrial.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*X2K-lmTPKu4Y71OvZB5H2A.gif" alt="They walk amongst us and are very cute"><em>They walk amongst us and are very cute</em></p>
<h2 id="moon-fairies"><strong>Moon Fairies</strong></h2>
<p>Pokemon X and Y brought with it the surprise of a new Pokemon type — a shakeup that hadn’t occurred since the release of Pokemon Gold and Silver. Some earlier generation Pokemon like Clefairy and Jigglypuff were even retconned into this new Fairy type, fully or partially. However, the aesthetic of the fairy type seemed a little haphazard, and many fans initially considered it a slapshod mechanical excuse to nerf the powerful dragon type.</p>
<p>There may have been a more solid, if not ludicrous justification.</p>
<p>XYSider’s post notes that “Fairy-type Pokemon had more plot presence, an idea being that they’d be aliens from the Moon who came to Earth even further in the past and had learned to live with humans in peace.” This lines up — Clefairy, the literal “Fairy Pokemon”, has strong associations with the moon (everyone fondly remembers the anime Clefairy and their inexplicable UFO). The fairy-type move Moonblast was introduced in X and Y, and the healing move Moonlight was retconned to fairy type.</p>
<p>Whether this was a good idea or a bad idea, the whole Mooninites thing was dropped and Game Freak introduced the type with minimal fanfare.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*czSnf9LJJY9YtMAAROHqzg.png" alt="Diantha, Extraterrestrial or just extra?"><em>Diantha, Extraterrestrial or just extra?</em></p>
<p>League Champion Diantha, ostensibly the games final boss, was “intended to be one of these more benevolent Moon aliens, their leader”. While in the final game she’s more of an aloof movie star, her signature Pokemon is the psychic- and fairy-type Gardevoir. She even sports inexplicable fairy wings — though maybe it’s just couture.</p>
<p>The design for Valerie, the fairy-type gym leader, was apparently a hold over from this moon-alien aesthetic as well. In the finished product, she holds the title of gym leader, and her gym is a giant doll house. And I can’t tell if that’s more or less unnerving.</p>
<p>Either way, if Valerie’s original concept was covered up, they could have done a better job of it. Valerie remains straight up alien. I mean look at this.</p>
<p>This ain’t human:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*sA0wgMFGZcBseFSCtEaPJw.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="mega-evolution-is-1982s-the-thing-basically"><strong>Mega Evolution is 1982’s <em>The Thing</em>, Basically</strong></h2>
<p>The story was apparently more intimately tied to the revolutionary Mega Stones. They were also of alien origin, being “pieces of AZ’s spaceship that spread across Earth when he landed.” According to XYSider, “the original idea for Mega Evolutions were much more alien in appearance, with elements akin to Deoxys suggesting he hailed from the same planet.”</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*p4pWNxrz4zQWobswPwZAxQ.png" alt="The Mega Evolution Sigil"><em>The Mega Evolution Sigil</em></p>
<p>While that may at first sound a bit bizarre, it’s worth pointing X and Y’s Japanese logos display the “sigil” for mega evolution, which has a striking similarity to the double-helix of DNA. This little sigil also appears above the heads of mega-evolving Pokemon. This motif was largely scrapped in Pokemon Sun and Moon, which started development after Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire were released in 2014 — the sigil has lost its “rungs” and appears more like a flame upon evolution. Perhaps at that point, evidence of X &amp; Y’s paranormal themes had properly scrubbed and put to bed.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3052/1*QiqjFKp11dh9Wqx3Czq9Sw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking at Deoxys design, it is clearly tied to that double-helix motif, holding the classification of “DNA Pokemon”. To further that point, most of it’s Pokedex entries describe Deoxys as kind of virus - f<em>rom spaaace.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps at one point, the intention of Mega Evolution was to express the powerful influence of Deoxys essence.</p>
<p>There are a few facts that could give this theory credence.</p>
<p>Many of the first Mega Evolutions seem to hint at a kind of space-alien influence. This is clear in the space-godzilla design influences of Mega Tyranitar and Mega Abomasnow, or how Mega Mawile gets way more John Carpenter. On top of that, it’s made clear in some designs (and future literature in Sun and Moon versions) that the viral “corruption” that Mega Evolution seems to have over Pokemon — they seem to go berserk in unnatural and blind rage.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1Ns5h9cQygIyGrhgSLuXNg.jpeg" alt="Go forth my sons, and space to the extreme!"><em>Go forth my sons, and space to the extreme!</em></p>
<p>As was commonly theorized up until X and Y’s release, Lysandre was intended to be the Mr. Hyde to Professor Sycamore’s Dr. Jekyll “a scientist who was exposed to a space rock, with the Lysandre-half being when the alien’s leader takes control of him”. In short, someone who Kurt Russel would have to deal with.</p>
<p>So what happened to this big wild conspiracy party? The post doesn’t go into much detail, but it seems that it was a mixture of prioritizing the models and plain old trepidation.</p>
<p>As XYSider recounts: “This drafted plot was deemed a bit too weird, and the paranormal elements were rewrote into more mystical elements which were then further scaled back”.</p>
<p>Apparently the plot point of Lysandre being Sycamore’s alter-ego was still included until late on in development, but they were eventually cut into two separate buddies from college. And then fiercely shipped by very rabid fanfic writers.</p>
<p>However, Deoxys wasn’t about to lose it’s weird, alien influence over Game Freak.</p>
<p>The games following X and Y, <em>Omega Ruby</em> and <em>Alpha Sapphire</em>, have a post-game plot that featured Deoxys heavily. This “Delta Episode” involved a literal space mission to smash an incoming meteor with your new <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rayquaza_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">god-pal Mega Rayquaza</a>. Once smashed, you find the meteor itself <em>housed a malevolent Deoxys virus</em>. The alien invader defeated and captured, you return to Earth.</p>
<p>This really cool animated short — part of the retrospective “Pokemon Generations” series, beautifully renders this haywire encounter of the third kind:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In <em>Omega Ruby</em> and <em>Alpha Sapphire</em>, this Deoxys meteor is suggested to be similar to the one that made possible the first mega evolution. This is just the author’s speculation, but this sounds like the writing team may have salvaged at least part of the scrapped plotline of X and Y.</p>
<p>After all was said and done, themes of extraterrestrial Pokemon were lavishly explored in 2016’s and 2017’s 7th generation titles. Alien-like Ultra Beasts, wormholes, and even M.I.B.-style visitors from “Ultra Space” were all drenching the scripts with that “paranormal bent” that wasn’t implemented in X and Y.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HjwI5E3y2zyTjv9_Mx2XMA.png" alt="The Ultra Recon Squad. Literally Aliens. Literally posing as humans. Literally."><em>The Ultra Recon Squad. Literally Aliens. Literally posing as humans. Literally.</em></p>
<p>A reoccurring character, detective “Looker” even plays a Mulder-esque investigator in Sun and Moon, a role that XY Sider mentioned was originally intended to be the case. <em>4 years ago.</em></p>
<p>Even if the plot was deemed too harebrained to use, it sure as sunshine didn’t stop Game Freak from doing the space thing anyway.</p>
<p>Sure, this crackpot theory may have been hopeful headcannon to make sense of a jumbled, messy plot. But there are several other insights shared by XYsider — specifically in scrapped mechanics, that suggest this post had more validity than it was given credit for.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay-mechanics"><strong>Gameplay Mechanics</strong></h2>
<p>Apparently, the game suffered from a rushed publishing date later on in development — priorities were placed on the new 3D models of each Pokemon, and so the shipped game not only suffered from a fragmented plot, but several mechanics were thrown in half-baked.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, because some features that were included in the game were absolutely naff. Sky Battles come to mind, which I fear may have influenced the ludicrous “hovering statically in the air” design of the game’s flying types. I still love you Skarmory, Tropius and Xatu. Please come down soon.</p>
<p><strong>Riding Pokemon</strong></p>
<p>The ability to ride on the back of Pokemon was seemingly slated for a greater role in X and Y.</p>
<p>“The feature ended up getting put on the back-burner a bit and wasn’t as important in the final game as it was planned to be originally” XYsider claimed. “at one point riding Pokemon was meant to completely replace the Bike, but this proved difficult to do.”</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*hVISazBsvSDr5mPjBEagsA.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>While the Pokemon-riding mechanic did see limited implementation in X and Y, it came back in full force in Sun &amp; Moon. Just like XYsider mentioned, it even ended up replacing the bike. With the ride mechanic continuing to serve this role in the recent Pokemon “Let’s Go” games, it seems realistic that the team wanted to implement the feature either way.</p>
<p><strong>Pokemon Size Diversity</strong></p>
<p>This is a fairly deep cut for those interested, but I think it’s enough of a called shot to back up the XYsider post. According to the post, there was meant to be a size mechanic implemented in the games — pokemon could be larger or smaller, and it could affect their stats.</p>
<p>Pumpkaboo/Gourgeist line (which are based off of halloween pumpkins) did actually utilize this feature, having four variations from “small size” to “super size”.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*rY2m53Wx9L9S11TV0ZpnUQ.png" alt="small bab to large order with fries"><em>small bab to large order with fries</em></p>
<p>XYSider explains: “The idea of Pokemon being multiple sizes and effecting their stats, as seen with the Pumpkaboo line… (It’s) an idea the team has played around with for years but have never included due to the gameplay changes it’d cause.”</p>
<p>Upon the release of the mobile game Pokemon Go, followed by the Switch’s Let’s Go Pikachu/Eevee games, it’s clear that Game Freak did eventually decide to implement size difference, albeit in a mechanically and visually softer manner. While sizes now differentiate between Pokemon, it doesn’t affect any stats or model renders. Who knows, if the previous claims were correct, we might see actual model variation in future Pokemon titles.</p>
<h2 id="tinfoil-hat-but-make-it-pokemon"><strong>Tinfoil Hat, but make it Pokemon</strong></h2>
<p>I know full well that this specific, four year old 4chan post might just be some bizarre confirmation bias on my psychological part. So, just for kicks, I want to hold it up to a set of standards familiar to the Pokemon community.</p>
<p>“Serebii Confirmed” is an old meme in the Pokemon fandom. If something is decided legitimate by the Pokemon news website Serebii.net, then the community can rest assured that the topic at hand isn’t fabricated for clout. I’m sure the webmaster for Serebii, Joe Merrick, sees a lot of poorly stitched-together leaks and spun info. This has been his pinned tweet for the last year or so:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XrzD_PMspWZpv4MStBTPqQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Do I think this is the grim line in the sand drawn by a tired, tired individual? Yes. But more usefully, let’s apply it to our XYSider post to help determine its authenticity.</p>
<p>At the time, it was obviously classifiable as a rumour. There was clearly and admittedly no properly supported evidence.</p>
<p>But elements of the post were slowly but surely given at least an air of retroactive validity. They became more true with each scrapped mechanic and plot point eventually becoming officially utilized. Does that count as confirmation?</p>
<p>After once asking Merrick about this post, I was promptly ignored and I didn’t see it come up in any later conversation. However, without Merrick’s direct input I feel fairly confident in calling this post a leak by the prior standards.</p>
<p>Because if it wasn’t a leak, it was an <em>extremely</em> spooky set of called shots.</p>
<h2 id="giving-it-time-with-game-freak"><strong>Giving it Time with Game Freak</strong></h2>
<p>Obviously at the time of XYSider’s post, people were skeptical and uninterested. There was a lot of information, and none of it was promising anything new. It wasn’t the kind of leak people would want.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*d3w4rvugDqZ4tuxyKObyzg.png" alt="listen, it’s what the people wanted."><em>listen, it’s what the people wanted.</em></p>
<p>A few months later, Hoenn was finally confirmed, and Pokemon X and Y never received a satisfying director’s cut *a la *the Crystal, Emerald, and Platinum versions.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, because there are so many open threads in that game that they actually obscure its strengths. Pokemon X and Y was a big mechanical leap into 3D, a first for the mainline Pokemon series. Lumiose City’s over the shoulder camera angle was a really cool experiment, and the notion of seeing wild Pokemon in the overworld were first realized. Hidden stats were less obscured, and competitive battling was made more accessible than ever.</p>
<p>But there’s that locked door in the Kalos Badlands. Massive, promising buildings with nothing to offer. There’s the creepypasta-style ghost that says “you’re not the one”. There’s the totally bizarre inclusion of Zygarde, “protector of the ecosystem”, only to be realized in Sun and Moon minus any context whatsoever. The X and Y era leaned heavily on the anime for any plot whatsoever surrounding the games biggest elements.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2880/1*OhL6QaLG-RKO-j-u5eYtmA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What are Yveltal and Xerneas about? What did they do? Did they interact? Why is one a cocoon and one a tree. These feel less like mysteries and more like jumped narrative-ships.</p>
<p>If XYsider’s claims are at all valid, Game Freak seems to consistently bite off more than they can chew. To compound that eagerness, massive changes happen very late in development, possibly hurting both narrative and mechanics as publishing dates draw near. Developer crunch is unfortunately common in this industry, but the scope that Game Freak yearns for seems to get them in a real hot seat.</p>
<p>In the fantastic <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/12/31/the-history-of-pokemon.aspx">Gameinformer feature “The History of Pokemon”</a> by interviewer Kyle Hillard, director Shigeru Ohmori describes the implementation of one of Sun and Moon’s core concepts, the scrapping of Gyms for the Island Challenge.</p>
<p>Notably, it was a *late *implementation — during the debugging phase.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*wnqyboZwABkMDZhM" alt=""></p>
<p><em>‘It was so late, in fact, that the programming and art teams were not able to lend much help for the trials’ creation. “I had to figure out a way that just us game designers could create these features and figure out the content of the actual trials. So we had a basic scripting language we could use, but obviously we couldn’t create new visuals,” Ohmori says. “We were trying things like maybe we have a sound quiz or something, so we came up with a lot of ideas based in the restrictions we had.”</em></p>
<p>I do love this series, and I truly believe there are some geniuses of the art form behind every Pokemon entry. But boy, do they shoot themselves in the foot. Game Freak’s resourcefulness to make an engaging island challenge was evidence of their talent in spite of restriction, but I dream of the game they can make given more time. More resources. More possibility.</p>
<p>The studio is notorious for always seeming a bit behind the curve, and I don’t sit comfortably with feeling that the most ambitious leaps are always the weakest versions of their potential.</p>
<p>However, Pokemon Let’s Go Pikachu and Let’s Go Eevee, despite not being “core” games, have been such a nice trip through what Pokemon can be. If the result of their lofty aspirations is coming to a head, <em>Let’s Go</em> feels promising.</p>
<p>It may take years (and a few games) for Game Freak to realize their ideas, but they’re *good *ideas. If the XYsider post holds water, almost all the scrapped concepts of X and Y have finally seen utilization.</p>
<p>Does Game Freak has to be secretive about it? Well, I suppose it’s better to surprise than to disappoint. The first promo video of Pokemon Sun and Moon featured concept artwork — a firetruck with a Blastoise instead of a hose. A mobile, Ambulance-style pokemon centre. A trainer, riding on the bed of a truck with their pokemon. These didn’t make their way into the final game.</p>
<p>Some more lofty ideas left on the floor? Who knows — we may see something like it in the upcoming 2019 entries? Perhaps I can finally realize my “Studio Ghibli but Pokemon” moment, and belt out “Take me Home, Johto Roads”.</p>
<p>Maybe I see Game Freak’s potential as a double-edged sword — their enthusiasm getting stuck in “blue sky” brainstorming, burning them in the implementation stage. Though, maybe that’s why I love Game Freak. Their unbridled passion to make a warm, peaceful world just that more believable remains unmatched.</p>
<p>Maybe at the of the day…</p>

            <description>The secret of Minecraft And its challenge to the rest of us minecraft.gamepedia.com
It’s almost inevitable: I encounter *Minecraft *somewhere online—it’s easy to do, because there’s a lot of Minecraft out there—and I end up convinced I’m doing the wrong thing with my life.
Let me explain.
Briefly, for the uninitiated: Minecraft is a video game, first released in 2009 as a buggy prototype by a solo Swedish programmer named Markus Persson.</description>

<p>It’s almost inevitable: I encounter *Minecraft *somewhere online—it’s easy to do, because there’s a lot of <em>Minecraft</em> out there—and I end up convinced I’m doing the wrong thing with my life.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Briefly, for the uninitiated: <em>Minecraft</em> is a video game, first released in 2009 as a buggy prototype by a solo Swedish programmer named Markus Persson. The complete game was released in 2011, and in the years since, <em>Minecraft</em> has matured, expanded, and sold <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/4/29/5665834/minecraft-sales-15m-copies-pc">tens of millions</a> of copies.</p>
<p>Oh, and there’s <a href="http://www.2playerproductions.com/projects/minecraft">a documentary</a>.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://www.kohls.com/search.jsp?search=minecraft&amp;submit-search=web-regular">T-shirts</a>.</p>
<p>I am obsessed with this game and what it has achieved. If you are a writer, a cartoonist, a filmmaker, a designer—really, anyone who aspires to engage human brains, particularly young ones—I think you should be, too.</p>
<p>In <em>Minecraft</em>, the player is dropped into a freshly-generated world composed of coarse blocks that represent dirt, trees, rock, water, and more:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2732/1*cUVAWCBiK7y2gzVcNS6axQ.png" alt="minecraft.gamepedia.com"><em>minecraft.gamepedia.com</em></p>
<p>There are dangerous creatures lurking in this world, including but not limited to giant spiders and skeleton archers. But they only venture out at night, and they can be deterred by walls. The sun (a bright cube) sets fast, so your first task is always the same: Build a shelter.</p>
<p>The genius of <em>Minecraft</em> is that the game does not specify how this is done.</p>
<p>The game’s core activity is the creation of new materials and objects through the arrangement of more basic substances in specific patterns on a “crafting table,” represented in the game as a matrix of cells.</p>
<p>To me, these <em>Minecraft</em> “recipes” resemble nothing so much…</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*VwL_-PwY_QsIc7D1gcpYkw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*J0PwhpDvTIlNNF3uuogZlw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XGdecLgAp2itsvkWGM5YnQ.jpeg" alt="minecraft.gamepedia.com"><em>minecraft.gamepedia.com</em></p>
<p>…as arcane runes.</p>
<p>To play the game, you need to know the runes, the recipes. Where do you learn them? Not in <em>Minecraft</em>. There is no senior alchemist to consult.</p>
<p>No help menu.</p>
<p>No manual.</p>
<p>People often compare *Minecraft *to LEGO; both support open-ended creation (once you’ve mastered the crafting table, you can build nearly anything) and, of course, they share an essential blockiness. But I think this comparison is misleading, because a LEGO set always includes instructions, and <em>Minecraft</em> comes with none.</p>
<p><em>Minecraft</em> is a game about creation, yes. But it is just as much a game about secret knowledge.</p>
<p>It’s not <em>that</em> secret, of course. From that first buggy release onward, all the ins and outs of surviving and building in <em>Minecraft</em> have been documented by players, on wikis and YouTube, in ever-increasing and now mind-boggling detail. Honestly, I have no idea how you would play the game <em>without</em> first browsing one of those wikis or watching one of those videos. Trial and error? There would be a lot of errors.</p>
<p>To play, you <em>must</em> seek information elsewhere.</p>
<p>Was it a conscious decision? A strategic bit of design? I don’t know. Maybe Markus Persson always intended to create an in-game tutorial but never got around to it. If so: lucky him, and lucky us, because by requiring the secret knowledge to be stored, and sought, elsewhere, he laid the foundation for <em>Minecraft</em>’s true form.</p>
<p>*Minecraft-*the-game, maintained in Sweden by Persson’s small studio, is just the seed, or maybe the soil. The true Minecraft (no italics, for we are speaking of something larger now) is the game <em>plus</em> the sprawling network of tutorials, wikis, galleries, videos—seriously, search for “minecraft” on YouTube and be amazed—mods, forum threads, and more. The true Minecraft is the oral tradition: secrets and <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Herobrine">rumors</a> shared in chat rooms, across cafeteria tables, between block-faced players inside the game itself.</p>
<p>The true Minecraft is the books.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*ImbrzlfqYRBCCTqKBZ2xoA.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Scholastic publishes these concise, child-friendly guides to the game. Two of them are <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/63195-ya-tops-nielsen-and-kindle-lists-for-2014-so-far.html">among the best-selling books of 2014 so far</a>, on a short list with titles like <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> and *The Goldfinch. *To me, they are the most salient symbol of the game’s success.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself a child. Imagine yourself given one of these books: not merely a <em>story</em> of exploration and adventure, but a <em>manual</em> to such.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*FkJK1Xumbwf1o5ys3vbBbw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Imagine yourself acquiring the keys to a mutable world in which you can explore caves, fight spiders, build castles, ride pigs, blow up mountains, construct aqueducts to carry water to your summer palace… anything.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself a child, in possession of the secret knowledge.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be enough on its own. Obscure techniques have been a part of video games from the beginning; <em>Nintendo Power</em> surely had a dusting of secret knowledge. What’s different here is that <em>Minecraft</em> connects this lure to the objective not of beating the game, but making <em>more</em> of the game.</p>
<p>“Game” doesn’t even do it justice. What we’re really talking about here is a generative, networked system laced throughout with secrets.</p>
<p>Five years in, Minecraft (the system) has bloomed into something bigger and more beautiful than any game studio — whether a tiny one like Markus Persson’s or a huge one like EA — could ever produce on its own. The scale of it is staggering; overwhelming. As you explore the extended <em>Minecraft</em>-verse online, you start to get the same oceanic feeling that huge internet systems like YouTube and Twitter often inspire: the mingling of despair (“I’ll never see it all”) with delight (“People made this”) with dizzying anthropic awe (“So… many… people.”)</p>
<p>Turns out you can do a lot with those blocks.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*iUWXt0N6GF2NgjwcbnomTg.jpeg" alt="WesterosCraft. OMG."><em>WesterosCraft. OMG.</em></p>
<p>We’re in a new century now, and its hallmark is humans doing things together, mostly on screens, at scales unimaginable in earlier times.</p>
<p>In the 2010s and beyond, it is not the case that every cultural product ought to be a generative, networked system.</p>
<p>It is, I believe, the case that all the really important ones will be.</p>
<p>To ignore the creative power of all these brains—millions and millions of them, young and old—leaves too much on the table.</p>
<p>I’m a writer, and don’t get me wrong: To publish a plain ol’ book that people actually want to read is still a solid achievement. But I think Markus Persson and his studio have staked out a new kind of achievement, a deeper kind: To make the system that *calls forth *the book, which is not just a story but a real magick manual that grants its reader (who consumes it avidly, endlessly, all day, at school, at night, under the covers, studying, <em>studying</em>) new and exciting powers in a vivid, malleable world.</p>
<p>I’m not a huge <em>Minecraft</em> player myself—my shelter never grew beyond the rough-hewn Robinson Crusoe stage—but I look at those books and, I tell you: I am eight years old again. I feel afresh all the impulses that led me towards books and writing, toward the fantastic and science-fictional… except now, there is this other door.</p>
<p>It’s made of blocks, I suppose.</p>
<p>“A generative, networked system laced throughout with secrets.”</p>
<p>When you write it that way, you realize it doesn’t have to be software. This is a stretch, but you could apply that description to the greater Star Wars universe—not just the movies, but all that followed: the books, the video games, the spit-spraying backyard lightsaber battles. And, based on all the fan fiction and wizard rock they inspired, I’d say the Harry Potter books managed to boot up a generative, networked system of some sort.</p>
<p>But now, in the 2010s, <em>Minecraft</em> improves upon those examples, because it does not merely allow this co-creation but <em>requires</em> it. And so the burning question in my brain right now is this: What happens when we take the secret of <em>Minecraft</em> and apply it elsewhere, in new ways?</p>
<p>My next book is going to be a plain ol’ book; a good one, I hope, but definitely not a generative, networked system, etc.</p>
<p>My <em>next</em> next book, though… well, I don’t yet know what shape it will take. But I have my eye on <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I am in no way a ricing expert. This guide is intended for fellow beginners confused on the very basics when it comes to the customization of their Unix system.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>After making my departure to Arch Linux a month ago I was quickly introduced to the world of tiling window managers. The idea is that instead of having a full blown desktop environment (DE) such as Gnome or Unity, you just have a window manager that utilizes keyboard shortcuts to organize your windows. With this you are able to create a very customizable experience without using up all your system&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<h1 id="so-what-is-rice--ricing">So What is Rice / Ricing?</h1>
<p>The term &lsquo;rice&rsquo; is used to describe a person&rsquo;s unix deskton where &lsquo;ricing&rsquo; is when someone is custom their desktop such as the icons, panels, or system interface. When it comes to ricing a tiling window manager though, the ricing of a user&rsquo;s system becomes much more involved. Basic things such as the panel bar and application launcher must be configured by the user.</p>
<h1 id="the-state-of-ricing">The State of Ricing</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s and there are more ways than ever to rice your PC. The reddit community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn">/r/unixporn</a> is a great place to stay up to date on what people are using for their setups.</p>
<p><em>Window Managers:</em>
The most popular WMs at the moment seem to be the young <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">bspwm</a> and the widely used <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a>, though people are also making some awesome <a href="http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page">openbox</a> desktops.</p>
<p><em>Panel / Bar:</em>
Lots of redditors are also using some sort panel or bar in the configuration which displays all sorts of information such as the time, volume, even the current song playing. I&rsquo;m not going to go into much details on how panels work, but if your interested check out <a href="http://blog.z3bra.org/2014/04/meeting-at-the-bar.html">z3bra&rsquo;s great introduction</a>. At the moment, <a href="https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar">lemonbar</a> seems to be the best option for creating a panel in your WM but other options such as i3bar also work great and are built into i3wm. You can check out my lemonbar files in the link at end of this page.</p>
<p><em>Program Launcher:</em>
When it comes to launching programs in linux, there has always been many ways to do it. You could just execute the program from a terminal emulator but that&rsquo;s lame and some programs make the terminal log for errors when executed like this. As I write this post <a href="http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a> and <a href="https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/">rofi</a> are the goto applications launchers for many ricers. Rofi is actually &ldquo;A window switcher, run dialog and dmenu replacement&rdquo; according to its homepage which means it can do a lot more than just execute your web browser (most of which I have yet to experiment with).</p>
<p><em>Terminal Emulator:</em>
The last part of ricing that I&rsquo;m going to explain in this guide is the terminal emulator. The terminal emulator allows the user to interact with the Unix shell while in the X environment, according to the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Terminal_emulators">Arch Wiki</a>. I personally use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rxvt-unicode">urxvt</a>, or rxvt-unicode, which I think works very well with window managers and is very customizable through the .Xresource file in your home directory. The terminal is a very important part of a good ricing and is very</p>
<h1 id="what-do-i-use">What Do I Use?</h1>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of what I&rsquo;m using on my Arch Linux System:</p>
<ul>
<li>WM: bspwm</li>
<li>GTK: arc-theme</li>
<li>Icons: papier</li>
<li>Bar: lemonbar</li>
<li>Terminal: urxvt</li>
<li>Launcher: rofi</li>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, snaps are great in theory - If you aren&rsquo;t familiar, a snap package is like a sandboxed application that is packaged in such a way that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can be sure you&rsquo;re running exactly what the app developer intended, as all dependencies and assets are bundled into the snap application package</li>
<li>The snap application generally doesn&rsquo;t own your entire system, it runs in an application sandbox of sorts</li>
<li>Snaps are cross-platform and distributed independently from apt/deb packages, and as such are usually more up to date than those found in apt</li>
</ul>
<p>Now this all sounds great, and it is in some ways (especially for app developers), but it comes at a cost: and that is generally performance and annoyances with application theming, access to user folders, and the like.  I personally find that if I want to run a sandboxed application I lean more toward Flatpak as it is more performant and seems a bit more mature than Canonical&rsquo;s snap system.</p>
<p>In any event, I usually disable snaps entirely on a fresh install of Ubuntu, and I&rsquo;ll show you how to do that in the new Ubuntu 20.04 release.</p>
<h3 id="updates">UPDATES</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This guide has been updated for Ubuntu 20.10, but the steps will be applicable to 20.04 LTS as well 🙂</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1-remove-existing-snaps">1. Remove existing Snaps</h2>
<p>On a fresh Ubuntu install, a few snaps come preinstalled. You can see the list of them using <code>snap list</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">kevin@olubuntu2010:~$ snap list

snapd              2.47.1              <span style="color:#ae81ff">9721</span>  latest/stable    canonical✓  snapd
</code></pre></div><p>To remove these, you will need them using <code>sudo snap remove &lt;package&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Run the following command to remove them all (the order of removal seems to be of importance here):</p>
<pre><code>sudo snap remove snap-store
sudo snap remove gtk-common-themes
sudo snap remove gnome-3-34-1804
sudo snap remove core18
sudo snap remove snapd
</code></pre><p>Typing <code>snap list</code> now should show the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">kevin@olubuntu2010:~$ snap list
No snaps are installed yet. Try <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;snap install hello-world&#39;</span>.
</code></pre></div><h2 id="2-unmount-the-snap-mount-points">2. Unmount the snap mount points</h2>
<p>If running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, you may need to perform this step.  I did not see the need on 20.10.</p>
<h4 id="ubuntu-2004-lts">Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</h4>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to replace the <code>xxxx</code> with the actual ID inside the <code>core</code> directory on your system, which you can find out by running <code>df</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo umount /snap/core/xxxx
</code></pre></div><h4 id="ubuntu-2010">Ubuntu 20.10</h4>
<p>In Ubuntu 20.10, I found that this is now under <code>/var/snap</code>.  Simply run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo umount /var/snap
</code></pre></div><h2 id="3-remove-and-purge-the-snapd-package">3. Remove and purge the snapd package</h2>
<p>Next, to remove the snapd package and all of its related services, run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt purge snapd
</code></pre></div><h2 id="4-remove-any-lingering-snap-directories">4. Remove any lingering snap directories</h2>
<p>Finally, you can remove the remaining snap directories on the system.  You may not have any of these directories after step 3, and that&rsquo;s okay.  I didn&rsquo;t have these directories on a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 install once snapd was removed, but your mileage may vary.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">rm -rf ~/snap
sudo rm -rf /snap
sudo rm -rf /var/snap
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/snapd
</code></pre></div><h2 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you are a user of the Chromium browser, you will want to add the PPAs before installing the browser, as installing the default <code>chromium-browser</code> package will automatically reinstall <code>snapd</code> &hellip; eww!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enjoy-a-snap-free-ubuntu">Enjoy a snap-free Ubuntu</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple, now your Ubuntu 20.10 / LTS 20.04 system is free of Snaps! 🙂</p>

            <description>With over 20 films and a handful of TV shows spread out over more than a decade, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the biggest franchise in the pop culture landscape — and despite the fact that they called the most recent movie Endgame, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like it&amp;rsquo;s going to be stopping any time soon. That massive scope has allowed Marvel Studios to create a sprawling, interconnected universe built on a shared continuity, and much like the comics the MCU is based on, that means things can get pretty complicated.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With over 20 films and a handful of TV shows spread out over more than a decade, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the biggest franchise in the pop culture landscape — and despite the fact that they called the most recent movie Endgame, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s going to be stopping any time soon. That massive scope has allowed Marvel Studios to create a sprawling, interconnected universe built on a shared continuity, and much like the comics the MCU is based on, that means things can get pretty complicated.</p>
<p>For the most part, the events of the films happen in the same order as the movies themselves, but there are a few exceptions. If you want a good look at when everything happened in the MCU, read on as we explain the complete timeline of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p>If you really want to know where things started in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you have to go all the way back to the Big Bang. No, really.</p>
<p>As you might expect from their name and the fact that they control fundamental forces of the cosmos — like Time, Space, and Reality itself — the Infinity Stones have been around for a long time. As the Collector explains in Guardians of the Galaxy, the stones were formed from the &ldquo;six singularities&rdquo; that caused the universe to explode into existence. They were then scattered across the universe, popping up here and there and awaiting the eventual arrival of a giant golden oven mitt that would be used to murder half the universe.</p>
<p>That, of course, was billions of years ago, but it&rsquo;s not the only thing to happen in those long eons. &ldquo;Millions of years&rdquo; before we get to the present-day MCU, Ego the Living Planet comes into existence, gains cosmic awareness, and seeds &ldquo;thousands of worlds&rdquo; with his essence in an attempt to create another Celestial being like himself.</p>
<p>As far as the heroes and villains of Earth are concerned, the MCU doesn&rsquo;t start with Tony Stark getting kidnapped in 2008, Carol Danvers being taken to Hala in the &rsquo;90s, or even with Steve Rogers volunteering for the Super Soldier program in the &rsquo;40s. The actual beginning happened thousands of years before that, and might even go back even further, to a cosmic cow licking a block of ice. That&rsquo;s the sort of thing you&rsquo;re going to run into when a good chunk of your universe is based around Norse Mythology.</p>
<p>This mythological time scale begins &ldquo;millennia ago,&rdquo; as we find out in Thor: The Dark World, when Malekith the Accursed lays siege to Asgard and is fought off by Bor, the father of Odin. Bor &ldquo;vanquishes&rdquo; Malekith, which turns out to be a temporary solution.</p>
<p>While we don&rsquo;t know exactly when it happens, the next chronological event that we see from our characters is Odin&rsquo;s conquest of the Nine Realms alongside his first child, Hela, Goddess of Death. During this era, the magic warhammer Mjolnir is forged in the heart of a dying star, and used by Hela. Thanks to her bloodthirsty ruthlessness and ambition, Odin turns against her, and in the battle that follows, Hela slaughters the Valkyrior. The sole surviving Valkyrie flees from Asgard, spending the next few thousand years drunk and depressed. Eventually, she winds up on Sakaar, a cosmic garbage dump that an immortal being called the Grandmaster builds into an interstellar gladiatorial arena. Hela is then imprisoned in another dimension by Odin, who (literally) covers up all traces of her existence.</p>
<p>Sometime after that (but still far enough back that people were writing about it in the 13th century), Odin and Frigga have a son, Thor. Shortly thereafter, Odin slays the frost giant Laufey and adopts his son, Loki, as his own. Not too long after this, during their youth, Loki turns into a snake because he knows Thor loves snakes, and then tries to stab him.</p>
<p>Also &ldquo;millions of years&rdquo; before the present day, a meteorite made of the super-metal Vibranium strikes Earth in Africa, drastically affecting the surrounding area. Much, much later, this area becomes the country of Wakanda when a &ldquo;warrior shaman&rdquo; receives a vision from the goddess Bast and founds a dynasty of kings known as the Black Panthers. The Wakandans become secretive and isolationist, remaining unconquered throughout history and using the Vibranium to create fantastic technology, away from the eyes of the outside world.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot that happens between the unification of Wakanda and the 20th century. If you count events implied by Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., then sometime in here the demon Chthon writes the evil spellbook known as the Darkhold and the Spirit of Vengeance starts turning people into Ghost Riders, but since the movies never really acknowledge that show&rsquo;s existence, these are some pretty optional events. Instead, the first big event of the century is the arrival of, well, the First Avenger.</p>
<p>In 1942, a Nazi officer known as the Red Skull takes charge of a splinter group called Hydra. With the discovery of one of the Infinity Stones (in the form of the Tesseract), he creates a technologically advanced army of his own. That same year, Steve Rogers volunteers for the Strategic Scientific Reserve&rsquo;s attempt at creating a &ldquo;super soldier&rdquo; using a technique created by Dr. Abraham Erskine. The project works, giving Steve the body of a hunky Chris. After the experiment, Erskine is assassinated, and his research is lost. Rather than risking their only super-soldier by sending him to fight in the war, the SSR gives Steve the codename &ldquo;Captain America&rdquo; and uses him primarily as a spokesman to sell war bonds in USO shows set to an extremely catchy song.</p>
<p>Eventually, Steve goes AWOL to rescue his best friend Bucky Barnes, and becomes an active soldier in the war, leading a strike team called the Howling Commandos. On one of their missions, Bucky loses an arm and falls from a train. Steve believes him to be dead, but he&rsquo;s actually taken into custody by the Soviet Army and brainwashed into becoming a super-assassin, codenamed Winter Soldier.</p>
<p>After attempting to use the Tesseract, the Red Skull is sucked into a wormhole, becoming the second person in Captain America: The First Avenger to survive an apparent death. In reality, he winds up on the distant planet Vormir, serving as a sort of spectral guardian for the Soul Stone. As for Steve, he crashes a bomber jet into the arctic to keep Hydra from destroying New York. He is also presumed dead, but survives, frozen in suspended animation for the next 66 years. Jeez, doesn&rsquo;t anyone who dies in this movie actually die?</p>
<p>While things are pretty quiet for the MCU between 1945 and 1995, there are a few notable exceptions. Peggy Carter continues to work for the SSR, first in New York in 1946, and then in Los Angeles alongside Howard Stark in 1947. Around this same time, the Soviet Union produces the first graduates of its brutal Red Room facility, where orphaned girls are trained as spies and assassins in a program codenamed Black Widow.</p>
<p>Sometime after this — presumably around &lsquo;48 or &lsquo;49 — Steve Rogers travels back in time from 2023 to reunite with Peggy. She continues to work in military intelligence for the next few decades with Stark, whose defense contracts turn Stark Industries into the world&rsquo;s leading arms manufacturer. By 1970, both of them are working out of SSR Headquarters at Camp Lehigh, along with a few other notable figures. Arnim Zola, who worked with the Red Skull back in the &rsquo;40s, is stationed here, and although his body dies in the &rsquo;70s, his brain is transferred into a computer databank that continues Hydra&rsquo;s infiltration of the government. Also, Hank Pym is working here, assisted by Bill Foster in his experiments with the size-changing &ldquo;Pym Particles&rdquo; that will allow him and his wife Janet Van Dyne to become the original Ant-Man and Wasp.</p>
<p>Between the &rsquo;70s and the &rsquo;90s, several small but key events happen throughout the MCU. In 1974, Howard Stark launches the Stark Expo, displaying the &ldquo;City of the Future,&rdquo; powered by a clean-energy &ldquo;ARC reactor&rdquo; that&rsquo;s about the size of a house. For some reason, he also hides the structure of a &ldquo;new element&rdquo; in the arrangement of the buildings, which is the kind of science it pays to not think too hard about.</p>
<p>In 1980, Ego comes to Earth, winning the heart of Meredith Quill. Nine months later, their son Peter Quill is born. In &lsquo;87, Janet Van Dyne is lost in the Quantum Realm after she and Hank Pym — as the original Ant-Man and Wasp — attempt to stop a rogue Soviet missile targeting the United States. In 1988, Meredith Quill dies from brain cancer (intentionally caused by Ego), leaving her son a mixtape of classic rock favorites. Peter is then abducted by a band of outer-space outlaws called the Ravagers. Their leader, Yondu, then raises Quill as a son, albeit very abusively. In 1989, Pym resigns from the SSR (now renamed as the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) after finding out that they intended to use his Pym Particles to create weapons.</p>
<p>Also that year, Air Force Captain Carol Danvers, who uses the callsign &ldquo;Avenger&rdquo; during her flights, volunteers for a test flight of a lightspeed engine created by scientist Wendy Lawson. Lawson turns out to be one of the Kree, a militaristic alien race constantly at war with the shapeshifting Skrulls, and her engine is powered by the Tesseract. When they&rsquo;re shot down, Carol&rsquo;s body is overloaded with the Tesseract&rsquo;s energy, giving her incredible powers and also wiping her memory. A Kree soldier named Yon-Rogg abducts her and takes her back to the Kree homeworld of Hala, where she is made to believe that she&rsquo;s actually a Kree named Vers, fighting alongside them as a member of the Kree Starforce.</p>
<p>While all of this is happening on Earth, things continue to develop in space. Thanos, an incredibly powerful alien from the planet Titan who&rsquo;s obsessed with balance, begins to seek out the Infinity Stones. Along the way, he lays waste to half of the population of entire planets, occasionally taking young survivors and training them as soldiers.</p>
<p>Assuming that most of the more humanoid characters are the same age as the people portraying them, then his two most notable &ldquo;adoptions&rdquo; happen in the late &rsquo;80s or early &rsquo;90s. Gamora is taken in as a young girl after Thanos kills half of the population of her home planet. Throughout her childhood, Thanos pits her against her adopted &ldquo;sister,&rdquo; Nebula. Every time they spar, Gamora wins, and Thanos systematically replaces pieces of Nebula&rsquo;s body with cybernetic parts in order to make her a more efficient killer.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Soviet government sends the Winter Soldier to assassinate Howard and Maria Stark. This will have massive ramifications later on, but the immediate effect is that their brilliant slacker son, Tony Stark, is left in charge of Stark Industries, along with Obadiah Stane as CEO. They continue to manufacture weapons using Tony&rsquo;s increasingly deadly designs, selling them to all sides of virtually every global conflict, with Obadiah in particular making a profit from secret arms deals with terrorist groups.</p>
<p>In 1992, King T&rsquo;Chaka of Wakanda goes to Oakland, California, to investigate arms deals involving stolen Vibranium. The culprit is his brother, N&rsquo;Jobu, who is killed in the altercation. N&rsquo;Jobu&rsquo;s son, Erik, is a witness to the whole thing and grows up craving revenge.</p>
<p>In 1995, Carol Danvers — still without her memories of Earth — returns to her home planet after escaping from the Skrulls. She teams up with S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents Nick Fury and Phil Coulson to stop the Skrulls from invading Earth, only to learn that they&rsquo;re not actually the bad guys. Instead, it&rsquo;s the Kree that are the problem, with Yon-Rogg and Ronan the Accuser en route in search of the Infinity Stones that will end their war of conquest once and for all.</p>
<p>Carol, taking the name Captain Marvel, fights them off and saves a bunch of Skrull refugees. In the process, an alien cat scratches Nick Fury&rsquo;s left eye, blinding it and causing him to sport a fashionable eyepatch for the rest of the franchise. Before she journeys back into space to aid the Skrulls, Carol gives Fury a pager that can summon her in case of a dire emergency. Inspired by Carol and her original callsign, Fury lays the groundwork for the Avengers Initiative, a program designed to create a team of super-powered heroes to deal with large-scale threats like alien invasions.</p>
<p>In 1999, Tony Stark meets bio-engineers Maya Hansen and Aldrich Killian at a conference in Bern, Switzerland. He&rsquo;s very rude to Aldrich, who remembers that as a sore point for about 14 years.</p>
<p>Throughout all this, Hydra continues its secret infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. and all levels of the United States government.</p>
<p>All that brings us to 2008 and Iron Man, the movie that launched the MCU. Almost everything from here on plays out in chronological order, in the years that the movies were actually released. Almost.</p>
<p>In 2008, Tony Stark is demonstrating his newest weapons in the Middle East when he&rsquo;s kidnapped by a terrorist organization called the Ten Rings, in what will eventually be revealed as a plot by Stane to get Tony out of the picture. While he&rsquo;s imprisoned, the terrorists force him and another captive, Dr. Ho Yinsen (who was also at that fateful 1999 convention in Bern, not that Tony noticed), to make weapons for them. Instead, Tony is able to recreate a miniaturized version of his father&rsquo;s ARC reactor, using it to stabilize a piece of shrapnel that&rsquo;s lodged near his heart. The reactor also powers the Iron Man, a suit of weaponized armor built from scrap, which allows Tony to escape after Yinsen&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>He returns to America, eats a cheeseburger, refines his design, and wipes out the Ten Rings in a brutally effective display of the Iron Man&rsquo;s weapons. He also defeats Stane, who attempts to kill Tony and create his own massive suit of powered armor. Tony then publicly reveals his identity as Iron Man, causing Nick Fury to approach him about the Avengers initiative.</p>
<p>Around the same time as Tony&rsquo;s capture, Dr. Bruce Banner — whose seven PhDs apparently include physics and biological engineering — is working on recreating the Super Soldier program. Instead of Erskine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vita Rays,&rdquo; he uses Gamma radiation, testing it on himself and turning himself into a rampaging, green, monstrous Hulk whenever he gets angry&hellip; which is always. After the Hulk inadvertently injures Banner&rsquo;s girlfriend, Betty Ross, he attempts to go underground, but returns to America in search of a cure for his condition. He winds up dealing with a scientist named Samuel Sterns, who wants to recreate the Hulk, and a soldier called Emil Blonsky, who turns himself into a similarly hulking monster called the Abomination.</p>
<p>Six months after revealing his identity publicly, Tony Stark is called to testify before Congress, because they are justifiably concerned about a private citizen building a suit of armor that can vaporize a tank. To create their own version, they turn to rival weapons manufacturer JustIn Hammer. After Tony&rsquo;s friend, Colonel James Rhodes, delivers a prototype Iron Man suit, Hammer and Russian scientist Ivan Vanko reverse-engineer them into an army (and navy, and air force, and marine corps) of drones. Stark also gets a new personal assistant, who is revealed to be S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and Red Room defector Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow. Stark and Rhodes, in a militarized armor codenamed War Machine, defeat Vanko and Hammer.</p>
<p>Speaking of hammers, while all this is happening on Earth, there&rsquo;s other stuff going on in the Golden Realm of Asgard. Loki tricks Thor into antagonizing the Frost Giants of Jotunheim against Odin&rsquo;s orders. As a consequence, Odin exiles Thor to Earth and enchants his hammer, Mjolnir, so that only someone worthy of Thor&rsquo;s power can lift it. It lands in New Mexico, where Agent Coulson discovers it, and after a bunch of hicks try to yank it out of the ground with pickup trucks, S.H.I.E.L.D. constructs a temporary facility around it. Thor eventually proves himself worthy, regains his hammer, and stops Loki from staging a coup in Asgard.</p>
<p>In 2011, a team of Russian oil drillers discovers the crashed Hydra plane in the arctic and alerts S.H.I.E.L.D. Captain America is thawed out and revived, and after realizing that he&rsquo;s in the 21st century, he joins up with Nick Fury&rsquo;s Avengers Initiative. It turns out he was just in time!</p>
<p>In 2012, Loki, last seen adrift in space after his failed coup in Asgard, is enlisted by Thanos to recover the Tesseract from Earth (his recent brief visit being seen by the Mad Titan as relevant employment experience). In exchange, Thanos gives him control of the Chitauri, a massive army of hive-minded destroyers, which would allow Loki to lay waste to the planet. Loki, apparently being in One Of His Moods that day, agrees.</p>
<p>The result is the Battle of New York, in which the Avengers — Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk, and Hawkeye — are gathered for the first time as a team. The good guys win after Loki is smashed against the ground five or six times, but the battle is not without its consequences. Unlike in the real world, where it&rsquo;s pretty nice these days, the MCU&rsquo;s version of Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen takes a lot of damage and winds up being a center of corruption and graft as it&rsquo;s rebuilt. This injustice leads blind lawyer Matt Murdock to take on the identity of Daredevil to fight against criminal kingpin Wilson Fisk, and eventually team up with other super-powered &ldquo;street-level&rdquo; crimefighters — Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and kinda-sorta the Punisher — on Netflix. The reconstruction is mostly handled by the newly formed Department of Damage Control, who take over the lucrative contract and leave construction foreman Adrian Toomes embittered&hellip; and in possession of advanced alien technology.</p>
<p>In 2013, Tony Stark in particular is overwhelmed by his concept of the universe suddenly expanding to include gods, aliens, and other unknowable cosmic forces. He deals with post-traumatic stress, which unfortunately coincides with the return of Aldrich Killian. Killian has been experimenting with Maya Hansen&rsquo;s regenerative &ldquo;Extremis&rdquo; treatment, which has the unfortunate tendency to cause its subjects to explode. To cover his operations, Killian creates a fictional terrorist called the Mandarin, hiring an actor named Trevor Slattery to play him in threatening videos. The plot is uncovered and stopped by Tony and Rhodey, and it all happens around Christmas because Iron Man 3 was directed by Shane Black.</p>
<p>Oh, also, Malekith comes back and Thor fights him, and Loki becomes the latest in a long line of presumed deaths that actually aren&rsquo;t. He stashes Odin in a retirement home in New York and then takes his identity, ruling over Asgard and putting on critically acclaimed plays.</p>
<p>In 2014, Hydra&rsquo;s decades-long plot to infiltrate and take over America is finally discovered by Captain America and Black Widow, who also learn that the Winter Soldier is a brainwashed Bucky Barnes. While Cap fights to restore his best friend&rsquo;s memories, the Hydra plot is exposed, and in the aftermath, S.H.I.E.L.D. collapses, leaving the Avengers without the oversight and support of the larger organization.</p>
<p>That power vacuum leads directly to Tony Stark and Bruce Banner attempting to create an artificial intelligence that would help protect the world. Unfortunately, they goof that plan up big time, instead creating a genocidal robot named Ultron who winds up destroying an entire country, Sokovia. In the process, the Hulk hijacks a Quinjet and blasts off to space, landing on Sakaar, but not before Tony and Banner use the Mind Stone to transform Tony&rsquo;s onboard AI, J.A.R.V.I.S., into a much more heroic AI called the Vision. Also, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, two definitely-not-mutants, join the team. Quicksilver immediately dies, partly from bullets but mostly because Disney and Fox were having a problem sussing out film rights. The destruction of Sokovia also kills the family of Helmut Zemo, who then dedicates his life to revenge.</p>
<p>While all that&rsquo;s going on, Peter Quill is out in space on a job to steal a valuable orb, which — unbeknownst to him — contains an Infinity Stone. That puts him in the sights of both Ronan the Accuser, who&rsquo;s been looking for another Infinity Stone since 1995, and Thanos, who sends Gamora after him. Quill and Gamora wind up running across Drax (a very literal warrior whose family was killed by Thanos), Rocket (a space raccoon who was painfully experimented on and given cybernetic enhancements), and Groot (a tree). After being imprisoned together, the five of them stage a jailbreak, defeat Ronan in a dance-off, recover the Power Stone with the help of the real power (friendship), and turn it over to the Nova Corps, a bunch of space cops on the planet Xandar. Shortly thereafter, Thanos attacks Xandar and recovers it for himself.</p>
<p>In 2015, an electrical engineer named Scott Lang gets out of prison and stumbles onto Hank Pym&rsquo;s old size-changing equipment. Under the guidance of Pym and his daughter Hope, Lang becomes the second Ant-Man, and helps to keep the Pym Particles from falling in the hands of an evil arms dealer. More importantly, it&rsquo;s likely somewhere around this time that a kid named Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, tries to capitalize on his powers by becoming famous as Spider-Man, and fails to stop a robber that later murders his Uncle Ben. None of this is covered in the MCU, but you might&rsquo;ve seen five other movies about it.</p>
<p>The following year sees Helmut Zemo&rsquo;s plan to destroy the Avengers reach its fruition. As the world responds to the destruction of Sokovia by trying to install new governmental oversight over the Avengers, Zemo furthers the a wedge between Captain America and Iron Man by revealing that Bucky was the one who killed Tony Stark&rsquo;s parents. He also frames Bucky for the assassination of King T&rsquo;Chaka of Wakanda, leading the king&rsquo;s son T&rsquo;Challa to take over leadership of the country — not to mention the identity (and powers) of the Black Panther. The end result of all of this is that the Avengers break up, the ones loyal to Cap go underground, and T&rsquo;Challa refuses to give Zemo the death he desires.</p>
<p>While all this is going on, Dr. Stephen Strange, who lost the fine motor control in hands after a car accident, seeks out the Ancient One and, after her death, becomes a Master of the Mystic Arts. He stops an invasion by Dormammu, a demonic force from the Dark Dimension, by using the Time Stone to die over and over again until the cosmic villain gets annoyed enough to leave the Earth alone. Meanwhile, the Guardians of the Galaxy encounter and subsequently kill Ego before he can manipulate Peter Quill into aiding his conquest of the entire galaxy.</p>
<p>In the absence of the Avengers, Tony Stark begins to mentor Peter Parker. As Spider-Man, Peter tries to deal with the — wait for it — evil arms dealer known as the Vulture, who turns out to be his homecoming date&rsquo;s dad. The Vulture is defeated, arrested, and sent to prison, but not before he and several of Peter&rsquo;s classmates figure out Spider-Man&rsquo;s real identity. Also, Tony Stark finally proposes to Pepper Potts.</p>
<p>In Asgard, Thor returns from two years of looking for Infinity Stones in various realms to discover Loki&rsquo;s deception. When they find the real Odin, he&rsquo;s at the end of his life, and his death allows Hela to escape her millennia of imprisonment. She destroys Mjolnir, blasts the two brothers into space, and takes over Asgard. Thor winds up on Sakaar, where he recruits Hulk and Valkyrie for a mission to overthrow Hela, which goes about as well as it can for a plan that ends with the complete destruction of Asgard via fire giant.</p>
<p>In Wakanda, T&rsquo;Challa&rsquo;s rule is challenged by his cousin Erik, who teams up with evil arms dealer Ulysses Klaue — there are a lot of evil arms dealers in these movies — and then betrays him in order to gain favor with Wakandans who know Klaue as a Vibranium smuggler. After being presumed dead, T&rsquo;Challa returns and, aided by Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri, regains control of his country.</p>
<p>After six years of waiting around, Thanos decides to personally seek out the Infinity Stones, and the results are devastating. He kills Loki and nearly obliterates the last surviving Asgardians, and an attack on Earth leads to things getting so desperate that the whole Avengers crew (except Hawkeye and Ant-Man, who are under house arrest for violating the Sokovia Accords) need to get back together to sort it out. They don&rsquo;t do so well. Despite fighting on two fronts, with one small team in space and a massive force on Earth, Thanos gathers the stones, snaps his fingers, and kills half the life forms in the universe, dissolving them into dust. Before he dissolves, Nick Fury uses the space-pager to alert Captain Marvel that Earth needs her help.</p>
<p>A month later, Captain Marvel and the surviving Avengers track Thanos down in space, only to find out that he&rsquo;s destroyed the stones and, with them, any chance of bringing back the dead half of the universe. Thor beheads Thanos, and the Avengers return home.</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, all of this happens while Ant-Man is involved in a relatively low-stakes heist movie. When the snap happens, though, he&rsquo;s left stranded in the Quantum Realm. While he&rsquo;s there, five years go by, during which the heroes deal with the horrific trauma in various, mostly unhealthy ways. Notably, Tony Stark and Pepper Potts have a daughter named Morgan, and Thor and Valkyrie found New Asgard in Norway.</p>
<p>After Ant-Man returns from the Quantum Realm (where, for him, only a few hours passed), the heroes realize that the solution to the problem is, of course, time travel. With the help of Iron Man and the now-smart Hulk, the heroes travel back to various key points in the timeline (including 1970, 2012, and 2014) to gather up the Infinity Stones of those eras, along with Mjolnir, circa 2013. They also inadvertently bring the Thanos of 2014 forward to 2023, along with all of his minions. Fortunately, the Hulk uses a rebuilt Infinity Gauntlet to wish everyone back to life, and virtually every hero in the entire MCU takes Thanos on at once. The final blows are dealt both by and to Iron Man, who dies on the battlefield.</p>
<p>After gathering for a funeral, Steve Rogers hops into the timestream to return everything to where it should be, returning after living a full life with Peggy Carter in an alternate past to bequeath his shield to Sam Wilson, naming him the new Captain America.</p>
<p><em><em><strong>PHEW</strong></em></em> now I just have to do this again when the new ones come out. I hope you enjoyed this informative post!!</p>

            <description>Why You Should Probably Learn Linux Let’s face it, Linux sounds scary to the untrained ear. Most average users think of black and white terminals, and pale, white, basement dwellers clacking assembly and basic into an ancient IBM machine when they hear the term “ Linux” arise in conversation. Of course, the same might not be said for Data Scientists, and programmers alike, but the stigma is certainly still illustrated inside of that particular clique.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-you-should-probably-learn-linux">Why You Should Probably Learn Linux</h1>
<p>Let’s face it, Linux sounds scary to the untrained ear. Most average users think of black and white terminals, and pale, white, basement dwellers clacking assembly and basic into an ancient IBM machine when they hear the term “ Linux” arise in conversation. Of course, the same might not be said for Data Scientists, and programmers alike, but the stigma is certainly still illustrated inside of that particular clique. However, despite this idea that Linux is only for the most advanced of power users, these days, Linux is easier, and better to use than it ever has been before. Regardless of whether or not you want to switch your primary computer to Linux, or love your Mac or Windows comforts all but too much, familiarity with Linux is an essential tool for any developer.</p>
<h2 id="virtual-private-servers">Virtual Private Servers</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*72YWSD25gsTdeD72dY-p-A.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Virtual Private Servers are the work horses pushing the data that we use every day. Without familiarity with Linux, good luck setting one of these up, as most of them are Debian-based, and use the apt package manager. As a result, for anyone that creates back-ends, including Data Pipelines, and things of that nature, this skill will need to be mustered in order to get the job done.</p>
<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*glD7bNJG3SlO0_xNmSGPcQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although Docker usually falls under the dev-ops envelope, it can end up being an essential tool for any software engineer, data-scientist, or startup entrepreneur. Being able to manage virtual systems is an obvious but sometimes underrated skill that you need nowadays to pursue professional work in any form of Software Engineering. Docker containers, for the most part are completely based on Linux images, so being familiar with using these images is certainly a skill that is worth having that will be very valuable to any incoming investors.</p>
<p>It’s a well-known fact that 96.3 percent of the top 1 million web servers are running **Linux. **This is because Linux servers are by nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Easier to manage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More Stable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easier to update (No downtime)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free and open-source</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightweight</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-to-day">Day-to-day</h2>
<p>If you ask around in the development world about the best machines to develop on, the worst answer is almost universally Windows. This of course is not necessarily Microsoft’s fault, as they couldn’t of had any idea what restrictions the NT kernel would place when they implemented DOS into Windows in the late 90’s. A-lot of loophole jumps are needed in order to get a lot of things working inside of Windows, and often a-lot of applications, GitBash, Conda shell, etc., although you can likely get by with smaller tasks using Windows Powershell. The one saving grace of the Windows development experience is certainly WSL. WSL provides a traditional Linux terminal virtualized inside of your Windows machine.</p>
<p>Moving on to Macintosh, they are actually surprisingly flexible and great to develop on compared to the latter. One of the few significant downsides to using MacOS, however, is the lack of a package manager. Although there are some options to remedy this, for example brew, it really doesn’t line up with tools like Apt, Pacman, and Yum.</p>
<p>With Linux we get the benefit of the bash terminal, that really is essential for development on a computer, and really makes transactions with git and software installation quite fluid. For use as a development machine, even as a side-product to your main computer, Linux is certainly the way to go for development in our current era.</p>
<h2 id="overhead">Overhead</h2>
<p>Despite your operating system not really making a huge difference on your ability to develop as a whole, but your efficiency of development, your operating system does have a significant effect on your hardware. This is one of the biggest reasons that I use Linux today, and haven’t considered switching back ever since I first installed Mandrake Linux as a child.</p>
<p>MacOS and Windows both tend to use a lot of your resources while just idling, with Windows being the worst offender of the bunch, sometimes using up to two whole gigabytes of memory at idle! Of course, this might not be a significant blow most of the time, but for deep learning, every single bit of memory counts, especially in Jupyter.</p>
<h2 id="it-doesnt-really-matter">It doesn’t really matter</h2>
<p>It doesn’t really matter what operating system you personally prefer. Your operating system is a piece of your personality, and no individual thing should change that piece of your personality. However, knowing Linux is certainly a valuable skill when it comes to doing anything with computers, especially if your build target happens to be the web, and you don’t anticipate using Windows Primary Forms as your expression outlet for the rest of your life. Knowing how to use a package manager, bash, git, and manage directories is an essential skill for doing anything remotely.</p>

            <title>6 Terminal Commands You Should Know</title>
            <link>https://jacobgoldstein.tk/6-terminal-commands-you-should-know/</link>

            <description>6 Terminal Commands You Should Know From switching your private keys to directory listings with hidden files
As a developer, there are two key things that are paramount to a productive setup: speed and efficiency.
The more time you take to accomplish simple tasks like searching for files or displaying their contents, the more is taken from critical development time. When working on the command-line, things like aliases and custom functions can speed things up and let you get back to developing more quickly.</description>

<p>From switching your private keys to directory listings with hidden files</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7764/1*e1iypsouAGB6jABtPW-JyA.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>As a developer, there are two key things that are paramount to a productive setup: <em>speed and efficiency.</em></p>
<p>The more time you take to accomplish simple tasks like searching for files or displaying their contents, the more is taken from critical development time. When working on the command-line, things like aliases and custom functions can speed things up and let you get back to developing more quickly.</p>
<p>If every time you need to perform basic tasks you have to make a trip to Stack Overflow or do some Googling that’s time you could have put towards more important things — like writing code!</p>
<p>Below is a list of helpful commands I’ve put together for accomplishing repetitive (sometimes annoying) tasks:</p>
<h2 id="1-ssh-agent-and-private-keys">1. SSH Agent and Private Keys</h2>
<pre><code>alias addkey='eval $(ssh-agent) &amp;&amp; ssh-add'
</code></pre>
<p>Have you ever finished working on a feature and tried to push your Git changes up to GitHub or access a remote server via SSH only to get an error or a password prompt? The most likely culprit is that you restarted your computer at some point and lost your SSH agent (along with any added keys).</p>
<p>One easy way to fix this is by restarting your agent and re-adding the SSH keys. You can add this alias to your bash profile — then all you have to do is type: addkey to get back up and running. Feel free to change “addkey” to something more suited to your style.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the ssh-add command expects your key to be placed in ~/.ssh/id_rsa in order for it to be added automatically. If you’ve renamed your key or have multiple keys you want to add you can specify the name using a path as an argument, like this:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/my_special_key

<p>You can even add this to your bash profile so it gets executed every time you open a new terminal window! Here’s <a href="https://medium.com/@adamtowers/how-to-customize-your-terminal-and-bash-profile-from-scratch-9ab079256380">a great article</a> by <a href="undefined">Adam Towers</a> on customizing your profile.</p>
<p>Now you’ll never forget to add your keys again!</p>
<h2 id="2-network-discovery-with-ping6">2. Network Discovery with Ping6</h2>
<pre><code>ping6 -I en0 ff02::1
</code></pre>
<p>You’ve heard of ping, but what about its (<em>s</em>cary*) *brother ping6, designed for pinging IPv6 addresses?</p>
<p>You can do the same obvious things like pinging IPv6 addresses and seeing replies, but there are more useful features hidden under the hood — if you know where to look.</p>
<p>When you pass this special address (which is a prefix) to ping6 and specify which interface to send from (replacing en0 with your own) you can see who responds and view their addresses.</p>
<p>This is useful for network discovery and even for gaining access to systems you’ve misplaced the address of. I frequently interact with a lot of equipment that uses IPv6 addresses and I have a hard time remembering them. Being able to send a quick command and “see what&rsquo;s around” on your local network is super useful.</p>
<p>If you struggle with grasping the core concepts of IPv6 (like I do) there is an amazing write-up on both IPv6 and IPv4 <a href="https://medium.com/coding-in-simple-english/a-beginners-guide-to-ipv4-and-ipv6-anatomy-fcc9444b0d4d">here</a> from <a href="undefined">Joe Cardillo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="3-detailed-directory-listing">3. Detailed Directory Listing</h2>
<pre><code>alias ll='ls -lah'
</code></pre>
<p>This is a common alias for listing the contents of a directory but with the added speed of showing hidden files, in list form, with added detail, and in a human-readable format. So, instead of simple, unhelpful output — like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XpOBWSxotoQo5HfOEIFU_A.png" alt="Listing a directory with plain ‘ls’"><em>Listing a directory with plain ‘ls’</em></p>
<p>You get much more detailed output, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*0LacD9qh4hI4dA8SEgdAkw.png" alt="Listing a directory with detailed ‘ls’"><em>Listing a directory with detailed ‘ls’</em></p>
<p>You’ll immediately know which items are directories, their user/group permissions, how large they are and when they were created/modified. I use this all the time to see when data is being written to files or checking who has access to a particular directory. Neat!</p>
<h2 id="4-current-directory-size">4. Current Directory Size</h2>
<pre><code>du -sch ./*
</code></pre>
<p>This is a straightforward command that will list the size of each item in your current working directory. This is useful if you are trying to scope out large files or directories for cleanup.</p>
<p>The output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>148K ./dir1
136K ./dir2
722M ./dir3
 45M ./dir4
8.0K ./dir5
 43M ./dir6
4.0K ./dir7
121M ./dir8
257M ./dir9
  0B ./dir10
1.2G total
</code></pre>
<h2 id="5-finding-nested-files">5. Finding Nested Files</h2>
<pre><code>find . -name &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Did you forget which directory a file was in? find to the rescue! If you replace <!-- raw HTML omitted --> with the name of the file you’re searching for then find will descend through all the directories (starting with the one you’re in) searching for your file.</p>
<p>Once the file has been found you’ll get some output like this which shows you where the file lives so you can grab it and get back to work:</p>
<pre><code>./dir1/dir2/file.ext
</code></pre>
<p>There are many ways to search for files. You can even install other dedicated utilities that have more bells and whistles. But find is readily available across multiple distros and straightforward to use.</p>
<h2 id="6-watch">6. Watch</h2>
<p>If you haven’t used watch you are missing out! The idea is simple, you pass <em>something to do</em> and <em>how often to do it</em> and it <em>does it</em>. Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<pre><code>watch -n 1 'cat test.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>This tells watch that we want to perform our cat command every 1 second/s. Once you run this command the screen will be rewritten to display the contents of the file just like if you had used less to display it. In the corner there will be a timer showing you each time the contents are re-displayed.</p>
<pre><code>Every 1.0s: cat test.txt                                                                                                          hostname.local: Fri Jan  3 08:57:29 2020

line1
line2
line3
</code></pre>
<p>This is useful if you have output piped into a file and want to see the changes as they happen. You could also tail -f the file but using watch is much cleaner because the screen is rewritten each time and watch handles the looping interval easily for you.</p>
<p>This is not available in every distribution by default but is easily installed with apt-get, yum, or brew to get started.</p>
<p><em>I hope you’ve enjoyed this list of useful and fun terminal commands! Maybe you’ll even implement some of these into your own workflow to speed things up and work more efficiently. What are some of your own favorite commands you’ve come up with?</em></p>

            <description>Best Linux Desktop Software Awards per Category for 2017! hey! you do realize that this post is only written because i was bored to do anything else, right?
also i want to make super clear that on these awards, we ran a set of completely democratic procedures, with a fully transparent voting. and by “we” i mean “me”, and by “voting” i mean a single vote! “mine” 👐
i will try to cover some basic categories, but not everything!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="best-linux-desktop-software-awards-per-category-for-2017">Best Linux Desktop Software Awards per Category for 2017!</h1>
<p>hey! you do realize that this post is only written because i was bored to do anything else, right?</p>
<p>also i want to make super clear that on these awards, we ran a set of completely democratic procedures, with a fully transparent voting. and by “we” i mean “me”, and by “voting” i mean a single vote! “mine” 👐</p>
<p>i will try to cover some basic categories, but not everything! basically whatever comes on my mind as im typing that!</p>
<p>so..</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-shell-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Shell 2017 Award</h2>
<p>Plasma from KDE! ..ha! not even close! <strong>it’s GNOME</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*rzXHBEnOgzAP_mS_reVXRQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>GNOME might be slow, GNOME might looks like shit, GNOME might have the most non-sense design ever, GNOME is missing the basics, <strong>but!</strong> it is most polished than anything else, it is most extensible than anything else, it has a good set of core tools/apps, and most importantly it has <strong>the biggest community support than anything else</strong>, and by far!</p>
<h3 id="runner-up">Runner Up</h3>
<p>elementary and deepin are two desktops that i also do like! i dont include Plasma only because of their awful workspaces. but lets be realistic here! where are you guys? all together, including every Linux desktop project, you dont even do the 1/3 of GNOME’s userbase! <strong>..and there is a good reason for it!</strong></p>
<p>well, the actual reason is that Mark woke up a day, and he thought</p>
<blockquote>
<p>..hmm, what shall i do today to upset Linux community? oh i got! i will drop Unity and i will use GNOME!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-web-browser-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Web-Browser 2017 Award</h2>
<p>Firefox did lots this year, both regarding speed, look, and extensions! but they missed one important thing! <strong>the Google Accounts!</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*1s_UpBCEURyrwyFGI5c7Pw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>as long as my everything is stored in Google, and as long as i have Android, i find it impossible to switch my web-browser!</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-1">Runner Up</h3>
<p>Firefox ofc! but it doesn’t matter! second place, first looser :)</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-music-app-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Music App 2017 Award</h2>
<p>look! i dont want to use web-apps on a Linux Desktop Awards article, but to me **there is not even music without YouTube! **music was discovered in 2005, when YouTube was firstly launched!</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-2">Runner Up</h3>
<p>Lollypop obviously!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*1o3T_JdS_hu130IU8vkfgA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>first because it is amazing, and second because it fits to my first award, the GNOME Desktop!</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-movies-app-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Movies App 2017 Award</h2>
<p>Stremio without any second thoughts!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*heCAK9vYu9TDLsJu4_AGRA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>it lately has some streaming issues with its torrent library, and the calendar misses shows (that are on Board however), but still there is nothing on my knowledge that can beat it!</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-3">Runner Up</h3>
<p>GNOME MPV! however i must confess that im really disappointed with the progress of this project! but still this is what i use for local videos ..speaking of which..</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-torrent-client-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Torrent Client 2017 Award</h2>
<p>before i was used to use Deluge, now im on Qbittorent and super happy!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*mcNHVPs6zLXZ73jyzHEM4A.png" alt="dont let the empty list to fool you! im torrenting more than i can watch!"><em>dont let the empty list to fool you! im torrenting more than i can watch!</em></p>
<p>features side i think there is nothing you wont find, the UI doesn’t look good, but it is very practical when you’re torrenting like pros, it hasn’t bugs, and it has very active development!</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-4">Runner Up</h3>
<p>nothing really, but if i have to say something i will just say Transmission ..which is awful anyway</p>
<p>meanwhile it is kinda hilarious but Windows 10 have better torrent clients than Linux Desktop ..for the phones!? <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/torrex-pro-torrent-downloader/9wzdncrdsgkg">like Torrex!</a></p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-code-editor-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Code Editor 2017 Award</h2>
<p>VSCode all the way! features side is almost identical to Atom (with extensions), but it includes a cool integrated terminal, plus is so much faster!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*UUKFDKCFywCZ99Bj8CkYBw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>what i do not like that much is the settings page and the integrated extension store, but at least those aren’t something we spend lots of time</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-5">Runner Up</h3>
<p>Android Studio or QtCreator, depending what you do</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-photos-app-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Photos App 2017 Award</h2>
<p>there is not a single app that i can vote! what i use, is a mix of GNOME Files, EOG, and if i need editing, it will be GIMP</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*KVkyv_QmU5ZJaW-3fvCVJw.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="runner-up-6">Runner Up</h3>
<p>as a runner up i will vote for GNOME Photos, although it sucks, but i do like the design, and the two bugs i have open (“Open With..” &amp; Custom Locations) are not closed by the developer, so i assume they may fix them, somewhere in the distant future!</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-tools-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Tools 2017 Award</h2>
<p>if Linux desktop isn’t miss something, those are the system tools! and here i could list so many! however everything begins from the terminal emulator and Tilix is simply the best there is!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*6VQhLSrutIXWWd_WPPfRzw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Tilix can do almost everything <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xroL6ZWg2Gs">but this!</a> GOD DAMN YOU KDE :p</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-7">Runner Up</h3>
<p>well, a filemanager should be second, and that is GNOME Files! <a href="https://medium.com/@alex285/in-gnome-3-28-files-remains-a-dumb-filemanager-66316e8c34f0">it is not that i love it</a>, but i dont see a better option really</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-app-format-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop App Format 2017 Award</h2>
<p>since i use GNOME, it is perfectly normal lots of my choices to inherit from that. so here the award goes to <strong>Flatpak</strong>, because all GNOME Apps are available on it</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*zLlLKUz6ghvNe8tcROmAqw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Linux App Stores and in this particular case Flathub and GNOME Software dont follow, their development is sad really, without logins, payment systems, recommendations, proper ratings, app statistics, etc, but at least there is on-going effort for all those</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-8">Runner Up</h3>
<p>Snaps obviously! although to be honest the only formats i have are either Flatpaks or AppImages! ..but lets say Snaps to keep Alan Pope happy :p</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-flatpak-app-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Flatpak App 2017 Award</h2>
<p>since i awarded Flatpak above, and since i just post random things that just come to my head, i made up this award and i will give it to Cuphead!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*A-lYEYyr7dlTK-Pr7JFFmg.png" alt=""></p>
<p>this isn’t about the game, but for the the <a href="https://youtu.be/Es2Jg0EK3sA">Flatpaking of WINE</a> which is a bless!</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-9">Runner Up</h3>
<p>GNOME Builder! a Flatpak app, to create other Flatpak apps! cool!</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-video-software-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Video Software 2017 Award</h2>
<p>video editing is consisted of lots of tools! it is not that you can do much with a video editor, apart some screencasts i upload :)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*xpXweduUf9Vch-6G_5NPrw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>so i give the award in 5 programs, that you can use in-together</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Kdenlive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GIMP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Audacity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Toonz</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="runner-up-10">Runner Up</h3>
<p>goes on Blackmagic with Fusion and Resolve, together with Blender for the 3D. actually that would be my first award, but it doesn’t work properly on Linux yet. lets hope that Blackmagic will become more Linux tolerant in 2018!</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-designer-app-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Designer App 2017 Award</h2>
<p>Gravit! simply awesome, although im waiting to see inVision too, which for start will release only for Windows 10 and macOS</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*fWEytLJuEawPG4NkPeR_Pw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Gravit has great tools and good snapping, but what is greater is their cloud store! you just save your work online completely seamless, and you can access and continue work from everywhere!</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-11">Runner Up</h3>
<p>Inkscape i guess! although the scope of these two apps is completely different, plus Inkscape UI sucks impossible much! i mean Inkscape is really a reason to uninstall Linux, and go buy a Windows and and Illustrator license :)</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-wallpapers-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Wallpapers 2017 Award</h2>
<p>not bias at all! you will find the best on <a href="https://goo.gl/y8xhIy">my Flickr account</a> :p</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*2vvZx1zZdTJw5aFu2UikNQ.png" alt="the wallpapers app is HydraPaper"><em>the wallpapers app is <a href="https://github.com/GabMus/HydraPaper/releases/tag/1.2">HydraPaper</a></em></p>
<p>carefully chosen wallpapers, with a large pool of topics ..but mostly anime!</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-12">Runner Up</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.pixiv.net">Pixiv.Net</a> ofc! altought it is very slow from Europe, and you have to pay to get access in all their services! but they really have great artists!</p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-office-suite-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Office Suite 2017 Award</h2>
<p>you wont find any Libre Office here! Office tools, Mails, Calendars, whatever such, i only run them exclusively on <strong>Google Cloud Desktop!</strong></p>
<h2 id="best-linux-desktop-distro-2017-award">Best Linux Desktop Distro 2017 Award</h2>
<p>im fully towards Rolling Releases, like Arch or Solus, and im also fully on GNOME desktop. however im gonna give this award to **KDE NEON! **..that is even Ubuntu LTS based!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*GID5z2q9cK8Fbbp1d5SNcw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>the reason is because i believe these big desktop organizations like GNOME and KDE should launch their own and complete solutions, and try to get revenue, <strong>because listen to alex</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>to be free, first you need to be rich</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GNOME is not a free desktop, because they simply lack the freedom to create. there are lots of things they want to do, and GNOME Desktop would be much much better, but they lack the resources</p>
<h3 id="runner-up-13">Runner Up</h3>
<p>Arch or some Arch based system. not only because is rolling release, but also because of the community support and their Wiki. however i believe Arch wont be here for ever ..no money, no honey :)</p>
<p>well, that was all! probably i could continue, but i got bored! hope you enjoyed the reading ..although i doubt :)

            <description>Linux: A Survival Guide for Beginners I survived the transition to Linux—and you can too

Switching from Windows to Linux can be really scary. But if you can survive the first few months, the eventual returns are exponential. Here’s how I survived.
TLDR   Though I am just an amateur in Linux, I was able to survive the transition and indeed benefitted from it.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="linux-a-survival-guide-for-beginners">Linux: A Survival Guide for Beginners</h1>
<p>I survived the transition to Linux—and you can too</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/12032/1*XXI-kg18liPn4XcfZmoqQQ.jpeg" alt="Photo by Chris Ried on Unsplash"><em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cdr6934?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Chris Ried</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/code?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p>
<p>Switching from Windows to <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> can be really scary. But if you can survive the first few months, the eventual returns are exponential. Here’s how I survived.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Though I am just an amateur in Linux, I was able to survive the transition and indeed benefitted from it. So these are my notes for somebody facing a similar situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> to start with. Choose other flavours once you know better and can decide for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get comfortable with following commands ssh, pwd, ls, cd, mv, cp, scp, grep, find, rm. Tip: you can use <a href="https://tldr.ostera.io/cp">https://tldr.ostera.io/cp</a> to get the list of most frequently used options of these commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to use the | symbol. Using this symbol, you can pass the output of one command as an input to the next command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-long-version">The Long Version</h2>
<p>In my first company, we were using Windows extensively, whether it was desktop machines we used for development or the servers on which we deployed our code. But when I moved to my <a href="http://azrisolutions.com?source=gokulnk">second company</a>, it was all in on OSS and hence using Linux was mandatory there. It became a herculean task for me. For the first month or so it was a nightmare.</p>
<p>Having gone through that nightmare and survived it, I am making this list to help others like me who are trying to make this transition.</p>
<h2 id="new-environments">New Environments</h2>
<p>Transitions are hard in general. New environments can be scary. If you’re a Windows user who has never used the command line, then transition to Linux can get really scary. Don’t fret because that is generally the experience of many people who are making this transition. Knowing that others also find it difficult can be really consoling at times.</p>
<p>According to me, the two main reasons that make transitions difficult are: <strong>lack of familiarity</strong> and <strong>fear of screwing up.</strong></p>
<h3 id="lack-of-familiarity">Lack of familiarity</h3>
<p>To address the issue of familiarity, I started using Linux on my office laptop as well as my personal laptop. I started reading blogs about Linux and followed some interesting Linux-related accounts on Twitter. I reached out to people who were good at Linux. I would walk up to their cubicles and ask them to show me their command history. I learned a lot more from this than from reading the blogs. Most of the times, since it’s just muscle memory, the programmers can’t explain it. But their history is a treasure trove.</p>
<p>I would recommend running the following command. You will get many insights into the commands your Linux heroes use frequently.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">history | awk ‘<span style="color:#f92672">{</span> $1<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>””; print $0 <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
</code></pre></div><p>Run the command on the terminals of the Linux gurus in your office. Ask them about the commands you are not familiar with and you should be able to learn a lot more than what a couple of books could teach you. Don’t forget that these are battle-tested commands and hence much more valuable than standard examples in blogs. If you cannot understand what the above command does, don’t worry—I’ll explain it later on in the piece.</p>
<h3 id="fear-of-screwing-up">Fear of screwing up</h3>
<p>I have been using Linux for a couple of years but I still have this fear. This fear was multi-fold when I started. One thing that helped me a lot was, I spoke to Linux pros in my company and made a blacklist—a list of commands that I should never use or use with caution. sudo rm -rf was the top of the list. If you are anxious like me you can use <a href="https://github.com/nivekuil/rip">https://github.com/nivekuil/rip</a> on your local machine.</p>
<p>When I was going through the stage of being afraid of screwing up this Youtube user was of great help: <a href="youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech/">ChrisTitus</a>. I wish I had spent more time watching him and learnt a couple more of his tricks. Find your angels and they will help you face your fears.</p>
<p>Now that your fears are addressed, let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-learn-linux">Why You Should Learn Linux</h2>
<p>There are countless reasons why you should learn Linux. A google search will fetch you thousands of articles about why you should learn Linux, such as “<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-benefits-of-learning-Linux">What are the benefits of learning Linux</a>,” “<a href="https://fossbytes.com/10-reasons-switch-linux-os-right-now/">Why you should switch to Linux</a>” and “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/38zytg/is_it_worth_my_time_to_learn_linux_while_learning/">Is it worth my time to learn Linux while learning programming</a>?” Those three articles are worth a read, but here are my top two reasons why you should learn:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Linux is ubiquitous</strong>: Linux is everywhere. So with or without your knowledge there is a high probability that you are already using or benefitting from Linux. Understanding the basics of Linux can therefore come in handy in many situations. If you are a programmer then that chance is fairly high. A fair number of applications are deployed on Linux servers. So learning it can be a lifesaver.</p>

<p><strong>Linux is versatile</strong>: <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/11396/217036">Both Linux and MAC are built on UNIX.</a> So if you are comfortable with the Linux terminal you should be able to use most of the commands in MAC terminal as well. <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/25463/does-android-really-use-the-same-kernel-as-linux">Android uses the Linux kernel. </a><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md">Raspberry Pi uses Linux.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Embedded_devices">Many embedded devices use Linux.</a></p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-start-learning-linux">Why Did You Start Learning Linux?</h2>
<p>As we’ve seen, there are many reasons for you to learn Linux. But if you are a programmer, there’s a fair chance that you fall into one of the two following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You read up about the cool things that Linux can do or you heard from a friend who just can’t stop raving about Linux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your laptop or desktop has a non-Unix OS. But your application or website is deployed on a Linux server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you fall under the first category, you have all the time in the world. So take your sweet little time. If you fall under the second category, then there is a fair chance that you are running against a deadline. So finish the next parts and get your hands dirty.</p>
<h2 id="man-command-is-your-friend-or-is-it">Man Command Is Your Friend. Or Is It?</h2>
<p>One of the first tips you get when you want to learn Linux is “Use man command, it is your friend.” While there is a certain truth to it, it can be overwhelming for many first-time users. All you generally need are the options for the most frequently used scenarios of the command—and that is what is precisely missing from man pages. Luckily for you, there’s a project called <a href="https://tldr.sh/">TLDR </a>which is trying to fix exactly that.</p>
<p>Just compare the outputs of these two commands to see what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>First, output from man pages.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2302/1*0QXjvacgzf1OHvziiX9s2w.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now the output from TLDR project.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZrSUDueSxi2uezlLqoq1iQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Do you see the difference?</p>
<p>TLDR is like the notes about commands I would have written for myself. I find it very handy. I installed the TLDR using <a href="https://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a> command sudo npm i -g tldr. If you have not installed nodejs I suggest you do it, as there are many node packages that are very handy. You can install nodejs using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04">this installation manual by Digitial Ocean.</a></p>
<p>I thought of sharing my notes on all the commands in this post, but then I came across a post by Andrew where he covers 101 bash commands:
<a href="https://dev.to/awwsmm/101-bash-commands-and-tips-for-beginners-to-experts-30je#whereis-which-whatis"><strong>101 Bash Commands and Tips for Beginners to Experts</strong>
*Andrew Jan 13 ・39 min readThe commands below are laid out in a more-or-less narrative style, so if you&rsquo;re just getting…*dev.to</a></p>
<p>He has categorised all the commands and has good examples as well, and I can’t do a better job than that.</p>
<h2 id="learn-about-bash-profiles">Learn About Bash Profiles</h2>
<p>I found bash config files or bash profiles to be handy, so it helps to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/415444/493742">learn the differences and how they work</a>.</p>
<p>One rule of thumb I follow is to add all my configs to .bash_profile and also make sure to load .bashrc within the .bash_profile file. I add my favourite aliases to this file. I keep a basic version of my .bash_profile in my private gist and I download the raw version of that on the servers where I need these.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="learn-to-use-emacs">Learn to Use Emacs</h2>
<p>One thing that I look for these days is commonality. This has helped me leverage what I know in multiple scenarios. For example, we are pushing a lot of Javascript in our team as we can use it in multiple scenarios, like our website front end, in browser console to scrape things quickly, debug our front end or learn from other websites, for joining collections in mongodb, and in nodejs for server side.</p>
<p>Stressing commonality helps us “Learn Once, Benefit Multiple Times”—a much greater ROI.</p>
<p>Coming back to Linux, I wanted to decide on a command line editor. I had the options of choosing Nano, Vim, or Emacs. I chose <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the commands used in Emacs can also be used in Linux shell. For example, you can use CTRL/CMD+A to go to the beginning of the line on both shell and Emacs. There are many such commands which work in both shell and Emacs. I think this is a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Since it is a command line editor, you can install it easily on any server. On every server where I am root I generally install Emacs. I am not sure if this is a good practice, but I generally find it very convenient. Yes I have decided not to learn Nano or Vim. Roast me for it if you want to.</p>
<h2 id="pipe-it">PIPE It</h2>
<p>Pipe command in Linux lets you use the output of one command as the input of the next command. This can be really helpful once you get the hang of a few Linux commands like grep, sort, awk, uniq, head, and tail. Piping along with these commands is immensely powerful. For example, I never remember what the options are in ls for showing only text files (and I don’t think you should either). I just run the following command.</p>
<pre><code>ls -l | grep txt
</code></pre>
<p>I know this is quick and dirty but it works in most scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, if we look at the history processing command we used in the first section:</p>
<pre><code>history | awk ‘{ $1=””; print $0 }’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
</code></pre>
<p>We are taking the output of the history command, and we are passing it to awk to remove the line numbers at the beginning of each line from the output. Then we are passing the output to the sort command so that we can sort it. Then we are passing the output uniq command to retain only unique lines along with the number of occurrences. Then we are passing it to sort command to sort it in reverse order. Then we are passing it to head command to list only the top 20 most frequently used commands that are present in our history.</p>
<p>How cool is that?</p>
<h2 id="grep-it">GREP it</h2>
<p>If you are used to SDKs and GUI editors, GREP might seem little limited. But most of the time, the differentiator is that you can chain the output of the grep command. That is very handy. Most of the time I am not really worried about the performance of the grep queries. The difference is insignificant. Only when the performance of the grep query matters I spend time on checking the options and fine-tuning it. In all other cases, I find it better to beat the heck out of grep and pipe to get what I want.</p>
<p>So, for example, when I wanted to check the list of services that were loaded I quickly looked at the pattern and used the following command.</p>
<pre><code>systemctl list-units --all | **grep** service | **grep** loaded
</code></pre>
<p>What I have done here is, I have reduced the result set to those lines that contain the word service, and from that result set I am again filtering for the lines that also contain the wordloaded. Let’s say in addition to that you want to remove the lines that contain exited, then you can modify the query to:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl list-units --all | grep service | grep loaded | grep -v exited
</code></pre>
<p>Piping grep with grep gets you what you want most of the time without remembering any other options.</p>
<p>There are many other tricks like these. But I feel these should be sufficient to get you hooked on Linux and motivate you to start exploring it further.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-do-in-four-lines-of-linux-code">What Can You Do in Four Lines of Linux Code?</h2>
<p>Short answer: a lot. My friend <a href="undefined">Chakri</a> scraped 1500 web pages, took the relevant information from those pages, and created a handy table to do his own analysis. The code is:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
for i in {10000..11500}
do
  wget -O — [http://](http://racetime.in/2019nebwdr/?bibNo=)[resultsite.com](http://racetime.in/2019nebwdr/?bibNo=11019\&amp;submit=SUBMIT)[/2019nebwdr/?bibNo=](http://racetime.in/2019nebwdr/?bibNo=)&quot;$i&quot;\&amp;submit=SUBMIT | grep “10 KM” | sed -E ‘s/&lt;tbody&gt;|&lt;\/tb\
ody&gt;|&lt;\/table&gt;//g’ &gt;&gt; output.html
done
</code></pre>

<h2 id="before-we-close">Before We Close</h2>
<p>For me, the primary goal while working on Linux was not to get overwhelmed by the command line and the learning curve. I designed my learning path to suit my requirements. Do let me know if this works out for you. If you are also a user who has successfully transitioned from another OS to Linux, do share your notes.</p>
<h2 id="shameless-plug">Shameless Plug</h2>
<p>When we are learning something there are so many things we read online and need to keep track. For this reason we built Learning Paths which helps you highlight, take notes and add tags across the internet. Think of it like medium but across the internet.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, I have discussed how to <a href="https://www.jacobgoldstein.tk/posts/2020/10/ventoy-multiboot-usb/"><strong>create multiboot USB drives

application. Today, I will see how to create persistent bootable USB
using Ventoy in Linux. As you may already know, a regular bootable
medium allows us to test the Linux distributions without having to
install them on the hard drive. When you are on a Live OS, you can do
all sort of things, such as installing applications, downloading files,
playing media, creating files and folders, customizing it as per your
liking and a lot more. However once you reboot the system, all of the
said changes will be lost. Because, you are working on a live OS. That&rsquo;s
how a live bootable medium works! What if you want to make all changes
remain intact even after rebooted the system? This is where persistent
bootable USB drives comes in help.</p>
<p>A bootable USB drive with persistent storage support will enable you to
install programs, customize the OS and store data permanently. Nothing
will be lost after reboot or shutdown. All changes will remain intact
and you can use a USB bootable drive as a portable Linux system. Ventoy
currently allows us to configure persistence support for Ubuntu, MX
Linux, Linux Mint, Elementary OS and Zorin OS.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="create-persistent-bootable-usb-using-ventoy-in-linux">Create Persistent Bootable USB Using Ventoy In Linux</h2>
<p>I assume you already have created a live bootable USB with Ventoy as
described in the link attached in the first paragraph.</p>
<p>Open your Terminal and navigate to the folder where you have extracted
the Ventoy script.</p>
<p>I have extracted it in a folder named “ventoy” in my $HOME directory. Cd
into the Ventoy directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ventoy
</code></pre>
<p>This folder will contain the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>boot CreatePersistentImg.sh log.txt tool ventoy Ventoy2Disk.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Now, run the &ldquo;CreatePersistentImg.sh&rdquo; script to create a backend image
file named <strong>&ldquo;persistence.img&rdquo;</strong> with <strong>1 GB</strong> in size, with <strong>EXT4</strong>
filesystem and with label <strong>casper-rw</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh CreatePersistentImg.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Or,</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./CreatePersistentImg.sh
</code></pre>
<p>You can also create a specific size image using <strong>-s</strong> flag like below.
The following command will create image file with <strong>2 GB</strong> in size.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh CreatePersistentImg.sh -s 2048
</code></pre>
<p>Or,</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./CreatePersistentImg.sh -s 2048
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <strong>-s 2048</strong> indicates the size of the image file in <strong>MB</strong>. You
can increase or decrease the size as you wish. You can also choose
different filesystem, for example <strong>xfs</strong>, like below:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh CreatePersistentImg.sh -s 2048 -t xfs
</code></pre>
<p>Like I already said, the above commands will create an image called
&ldquo;persistence.img&rdquo; with label casper-rw. Different distributions use
different Labels by default, for example Ubuntu use casper-rw and MX
Linux use MX-Persist.</p>
<p>You can use <strong>-l</strong> flag to set the label:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh CreatePersistentImg.sh -l MX-Persist
</code></pre>
<p>For the purpose of this guide, I am going to create an image file of
size 4 GB in EXT4 filesystem, with label casper-rw using command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./CreatePersistentImg.sh -s 4096
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Sample output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>4096+0 records in

<p><a href="https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Create-Persistent-Bootable-USB-Using-Ventoy-In-Linux.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>This command will create a file named &ldquo;persistence.img&rdquo; inside ventoy
folder.</p>
<p>Verify if the image file is created or not using &ldquo;ls&rdquo; command:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -lh
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Sample output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>total 4.1G

-rwxr--r-- 1 sk   sk   1.2K May 30 16:51 Ventoy2Disk.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Now copy the newly created persistence.img file to your Ventoy bootable
USB drive.</p>
<p>Next create a folder called <strong>&ldquo;ventoy&rdquo;</strong> in your bootable USB drive. And
then create <strong>&ldquo;ventoy.json&rdquo;</strong> file inside the ventoy folder.</p>
<p>Open ventoy.json file in any text editor and add the menu entries for
your ISOs in the ventoy.json file.</p>
<p>I am going to configure persistence USB bootable support for Ubuntu
20.04 ISO, so I have added the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;persistence&quot; : [
        {
            &quot;image&quot;: &quot;/ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso&quot;,
            &quot;backend&quot;: &quot;/persistence.img&quot;
        }
    ]
}

<p>Make sure the ISO and persistence.img files are stored in the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>root of the USB drive</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Also make sure
the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>filenames and syntax are
correct</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And more importantly, the ISO <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>filenames should not contain any spaces or

<p>After adding the above lines, save and close the file.</p>
<p>Now boot your system with the newly created USB bootable drive.</p>
<p>Choose Ubuntu 20.04 ISO for which you have added persistence support
from the boot menu:</p>
<p><a href="https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ventoy-boot-menu.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>You will then see another menu that you lets you to boot with or without
persistence as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<h3 id="create-multiboot-persistent-usb-with-ventoy">Create multiboot persistent USB with Ventoy</h3>
<p>In the above example, I have created only one persistence bootable USB
with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Ventoy allows you to create multiboot persistent
USB as well.</p>
<p>To enable persistent support for multiple ISOs, we need to change the
ventoy.json file to match with the exact path of ISO file and
persistence.img.</p>
<p>For example, I am going to configure persistence support for Ubuntu
18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04. So, I added the following lines in my
ventoy.json file:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;persistence&quot; : [
        {
            &quot;image&quot;: &quot;/ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso&quot;,
            &quot;backend&quot;: &quot;/persistence.img&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;image&quot;: &quot;/ubuntu-18.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso&quot;,
            &quot;backend&quot;: &quot;/persistence.img&quot;
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Configure-multiboot-persistent-USB-with-Ventoy.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>You can use the same backend image (persistence.img) between multiple
ISOs as long as it can be supported by the distros. Again, please make
sure you have specified the exact path and filename. If there are any
missing brackets, commas, colon, the persistence support will not work.</p>
<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<p>Now we have enabled persistence boot for both Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu
20.04 ISOs. Boot your system with Ventoy and select the OS you want to
load:</p>
<p><a href="https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ventoy-multiboot-menu.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>And finally boot into the OS with persistence support:</p>
<p><a href="https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Create-multiboot-persistent-USB-with-Ventoy.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<h4 id="save-files-in-custom-location">Save files in custom location</h4>
<p>In our above examples, we have stored the ISOs and persistence.img files
in the root of the USB drive. If you have stored the files in a separate
directories for the sake of easy navigation, you must mention the exact
path in the ventoy.json file.</p>
<p>For instance, I am going to save the ISOs in a directory named <strong>&ldquo;ISO&rdquo;</strong>
and persistence.img files in a directory named <strong>&ldquo;persistence&rdquo;</strong>. Here
is my Ventoy file contents:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;persistence&quot; : [
        {
            &quot;image&quot;: &quot;/ISO/ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso&quot;,
            &quot;backend&quot;: &quot;/persistence/persistence.img&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;image&quot;: &quot;/ISO/ubuntu-18.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso&quot;,
            &quot;backend&quot;: &quot;/persistence/persistence.img&quot;
        }
    ]
}

            <description>Ventoy is a free, open source and cross-platform program to create multiboot USB drives in Linux and MS Windows. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to format your USB devices over and over. Just create a bootable USB drive once and add as many as ISOs you want in future. Ventoy will automatically create the menu entries for the newly added ISOs and add them to the boot menu. Once you created the multiboot USB, boot your system with the USB drive, select the ISO you want to load and start using it in no time.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ventoy</strong> is a free, open source and cross-platform program to create
multiboot USB drives in Linux and MS Windows. You don&rsquo;t need to format
your USB devices over and over. Just create a bootable USB drive once
and add as many as ISOs you want in future. Ventoy will automatically
create the menu entries for the newly added ISOs and add them to the
boot menu. Once you created the multiboot USB, boot your system with the
USB drive, select the ISO you want to load and start using it in no
time. It is that simple!</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Ventoy ships with dozens of useful features as listed below.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li>Very easy to install and use.</li>
<li>Fast (limited only by the speed of copying iso file).</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need to extract the ISOs. Just boot from the ISO file
directly.</li>
<li>It supports Legacy + UEFI.</li>
<li>Supports UEFI Secure Boot.</li>
<li>Persistence storage support.</li>
<li>You can create bootable drives with ISO files larger than 4GB.</li>
<li>Almost all type of OSes are supported. The developer claims more
than 200 ISO files have been tested with Ventoy.</li>
<li>Auto installation supported. Meaning - you can add your template or
script for unattended deployment. For instance, kickstart script for
Redhat/CentOS, autoYast xml for SUSE, preseed script for Debian. Put
a script or template in the USB drive and tell ventoy to use it for
unattended installation. You can also update these scripts at any
time. No need to create a new ISO file, just use the original ISO.</li>
<li>Read-only to USB drive during boot.</li>
<li>The normal usage of USB drives is unaffected. Meaning - you can use
the USB drives for other purposes (E.g. File copy)</li>
<li>Upgrade Ventoy when a new version is available without recreating
the bootable USB drive again. Data nondestructive during version
upgrade.</li>
<li>No need to update Ventoy when a new distro is released.</li>
<li>To add a new OS, just copy/paste the ISO into the USB drive. No need
to start all over again.</li>
<li>Supports Memdisk mode. On some machines the ISOs may not load. In
such cases, you can use Memdisk mode. In this mode, Ventoy will load
the whole ISO file into memory and then boot it.</li>
<li>Plugin Framework.</li>
<li>Native boot menu style for Legacy &amp; UEFI.</li>
<li>Cross-platform. It supports Linux and Windows.</li>
<li>Free and Open source!!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-multiboot-usb-drives-with-ventoy-in-linux">Create Multiboot USB Drives With Ventoy In Linux</h2>
<p>First, you need to find your USB drive name.</p>
<p>I am going to use fdisk command to find my USB drive details:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo fdisk -l
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Sample output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[...]
Disk /dev/sdc: 14.54 GiB, 15597568000 bytes, 30464000 sectors
Disk model: Cruzer Blade    
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x4d924612
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, my USB drive name is <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>/dev/sdc</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Next, download the latest Ventoy script from the <a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases"><strong>releases
page</strong></a>. As of writing this
guide the latest version was 1.0.10.</p>
<p>Go to the location where you downloaded the script and extract it. I
have extracted it in a folder named &ldquo;ventoy&rdquo; in Desktop. Cd into the
Ventoy directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ventoy
</code></pre>
<p>Now, run the following command to create multiboot USB drive:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh Ventoy2Disk.sh -I /dev/sdc
</code></pre>
<p>Replace &ldquo;/dev/sdc&rdquo; with your USB drive name.</p>
<p>Here, the uppercase &ldquo;I&rdquo; will <strong>force install ventoy</strong> to sdc (no matter
installed or not). If you use lowercase <strong>i</strong>, it install ventoy to sdc
and fail if disk is already installed with ventoy.</p>
<p>To enable secure boot support, use <strong>-s</strong> flag. By default, this option
is disabled.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh Ventoy2Disk.sh -I -s /dev/sdc
</code></pre>
<p>You will be prompted to confirm the USB bootable creation process.
Double check the USB drive name and type <strong>Y</strong> and press ENTER to
continue:</p>
<p><strong>Sample output:</strong></p>

<p>After a few seconds, the multiboot USB drive will be created. The above
command will create two partitions. You can verify it with fdisk
command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo fdisk -l
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Sample output:</strong></p>

<p>Now open your file manager and copy the ISO files in the first
partition. Don&rsquo;t worry if you can&rsquo;t find which one is the first
partition. Your file manager will display the first partition only.</p>
<p><a href="https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Copy-ISO-files-to-USB-bootable-drive.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Alternatively, go to the location where you saved ISO files and copy all
ISO files from command line with rsync like below:</p>
<pre><code>$ rsync *.iso /media/$USER/ventoy/ --progress -ah
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that in some Linux distros, the USB might be mounted under
<strong>&quot;/run/media/&quot;</strong> location.</p>
<p>Done! We have just created multiboot USB drive with Ventoy.</p>
<p>Boot your system with USB drive and you will be pleased with the Ventoy
boot menu:</p>
<p><a href="https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ventoy-multiboot-menu.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Choose the OS that you want to boot and hit ENTER to load it!</p>
<p>Here is the short visual demo of multiboot USB flash drive created with
Ventoy:</p>
<p>Cool, isn&rsquo;t it? Indeed!</p>
<h3 id="load-iso-images-to-ram">Load ISO images to RAM</h3>
<p>Like I already mentioned, the ISO images may not boot in some machines,
especially in Legacy BIOS mode. Here is where &ldquo;Memdisk&rdquo; mode comes in
help. When Memdisk mode is enabled, Ventoy will load the whole ISO image
file into memory and boot it from there.</p>
<p>To enable Memdisk mode, press <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>F1</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --> key before selecting the OS. You
will see the notification on the top right corner when the Memdisk mode
is enabled.</p>
<p><a href="https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Enable-Memdisk-mode-in-Ventoy.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Now the ISO will be loaded to memory.</p>

<p>To switch back to normal mode, press F1 key again.</p>
<h3 id="creating-persistent-bootable-usb">Creating persistent bootable USB</h3>
<p>We know now how to create multiboot USB drives with Ventoy in Linux.
Using this bootable USB, we can test the Linux distributions without
actually having to install them on the hard drive. When you are on the
Live OS, you can do all sort of things, such as installing applications,
downloading files, playing media, creating files and folders,
customizing it as per your liking and a lot more. However once you
reboot the system, all of the said changes will be gone. If you want to
make all changes remain intact even after rebooted the system, you
should create a persistent bootable USB drive.</p>
<p>Ventoy can able to make persistent USB bootable drive. To know how to do
it, refer the link given below.</p>

Linux</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Believe or not, Ventoy is one of the easiest, quickest and ingenious
tool ever I have used to create multiboot (persistent and
non-persistent) USB flash drives in Linux. It just works out of the box!
Give it a try. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed!</p>
<h6 id="security-concerns-related-to-ventoy">Security concerns related to Ventoy</h6>
<p>The Ventoy website, forum and some files hosted in that site have been
flagged as Malware/Trojan by some Antivirus software. Check the issues
posted in the project&rsquo;s GitHub page:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>However, Manjaro packager <strong>&ldquo;Linux Aarhus&rdquo;</strong> has argued after code
review why there is no reasonable doubt on the security aspects of this
application. He claims &ldquo;there is no obfuscated code&rdquo;. So, I guess Ventoy
is <strong>safe</strong> to use. Please check this link to read the full

<p>(author of AUR comment) I think you can remove the caution note. Manjaro
packager Linux Aarhus has argued after code review why there is no
reasonable doubt on the security aspects of this application:

            <description>My new site Introduction Remember my old site, with my orange theme and ugly font? Well, that is no more!! I have created a new site with a site generator called hugo. Hugo is like jekyll, but more customizable.
Why? Why did I choose to use hugo, over anything else? The first reason is that it is more customizable. The options are not limited to github pages rules. My second reason is that it has lots of themes, like this one.</description>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Remember my old site, with my orange theme and ugly font? Well, that is no more!! I have created a new site with a site generator called <em>hugo</em>. Hugo is like jekyll, but more customizable.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Why did I choose to use hugo, over anything else? The first reason is that it is more customizable. The options are not limited to github pages rules. My second reason is that it has lots of themes, like this one. Hugo has a template system, so I can go to themes.gohugo.io and choose a theme, submodule it, and done!! THat is why I chose hugo over jekyll.</p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>Hugo may not be the right choice for everyone. You have to host it from your own computer, and setting it up is not simple. You may not have to run npm npm every time you want to edit it, but instead you have to build and rebuild and build and rebuild. So if you want to try hugo, it is FOSS.</p>

<p>In 1991 when Linus Torvalds for the first time publicly shared his newly made kernel completely free from minix code, then even he was not aware of its capabilities in bringing the revolution in the software industry at that time. The open source we hear today was not much popular back then, not until linux was founded. You see, Git a very popular VCS(Version Control System) was founded by the same guy to maintain the linux kernel. People loved this operating system not just because it was free but because it brought freedom to the computer and software industry. Linux can be customized for specific users and for specific hardware requirements.<br>
According to a survey by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux">w3techs.com</a> in 2020, Almost 29.7% of the websites uses linux operating system. Around 49% of all the developers uses linux as their daily drive for development purpose according to survey from 2018-20 by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/869211/worldwide-software-development-operating-system/">statista.com</a>. Linux is a popular choice among developers and tech enthusiasts. So today i bring to you these essential linux commands that you should know no matter you are an experienced developer or a newbie.

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After witnessing insane minimalism paired with a tiler (tiling window manager), knew it was my time to take the pilgrimage to Arch Linux. Some characteristics that make Arch unique:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_terminology#The_Arch_Way">The Arch Way</a> embody the principles behind Arch Linux; simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality and versatility.</li>
<li>Forces one to build the system up by hand.</li>
<li>This encourages you to question the role of each component of the system, and available options to satisfy that component (e.g. the terminal emulator).</li>
<li>The result is a highly tailored and minimal system that meets precisely your needs.</li>
<li>Practical and pragmatic documentation. The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch Wiki</a> is the gold standard when it comes to documentation.</li>
<li>The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a treasure chest of pre-packaged useful recent software. Somehow every program I&rsquo;ve ever needed has been available on AUR.</li>
<li>Rolling upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arch was born in 2001, when Canadian programmer Judd Vinet, inspired by the elegance of systems such as Slackware and the BSD&rsquo;s, set out to build his own distro based on a similar ethos. The first formal release, 0.1, dropped on March 11, 2002.</p>
<h2 id="boot-disk">Boot disk</h2>
<p>To bootstrap the install process, a boot key is the way to go. Obtain the latest <code>iso</code> image, and block write it to a USB drive using <code>dd</code>. <code>dd</code> (aka disk destroyer to some) trusts you know what you&rsquo;re doing and can destroy data very easily if not used correctly.</p>
<p>Use <code>lsblk</code> to determine the mapped device name (e.g. <code>/dev/sdb</code>). When ready, pull the trigger and flash the drive with arch:</p>
<pre><code>dd if=Downloads/archlinux-2019.03.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdb status=&quot;progress&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Boot the target system on the new boot drive. If all goes well, you will end up on a bash shell, in the temporary boot preparation system provided by Arch.</p>
<h2 id="post-boot">Post boot</h2>
<p>Get network connectivity:</p>
<pre><code>wifi-menu
ip a
</code></pre>
<p>Enable NTP:</p>
<pre><code>timedatectl set-ntp true
</code></pre>
<h2 id="partitioning">Partitioning</h2>
<p>UEFI (supports newer 64-bit based GPT) or BIOS (based on traditional MBR). If the below sys node doesn&rsquo;t exist, go BIOS:</p>
<pre><code>ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
</code></pre>
<p>Determine the target block device (e.g. an SSD) for installation, using <code>lsblk</code>.</p>
<p>Assuming a BIOS compatible system, will go with <code>fdisk</code> (not <code>gdisk</code>) for the partitioning setup:</p>
<pre><code>fdisk /dev/sda
</code></pre>
<p><code>fdisk</code> shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>m</code> help</li>
<li><code>p</code> print partition table</li>
<li><code>d</code> delete</li>
<li><code>n</code> new</li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, blow away any existing partitions (<code>d</code>), and create 4 new (<code>n</code>) primary partitions. Note when specifying the <em>last sector</em> can size with <code>+200M</code> style syntax, <code>+200M</code> is 200MiB, <code>+50G</code> is 50GiB. I cut my ~500GB drive up into the following 4 partiions:</p>
<ul>
<li>200M for <em>boot</em> partition (grub etc)</li>
<li>24G for <em>swap</em> (rule of thumb is 150% of total system memory)</li>
<li>100G for <em>root</em> partition</li>
<li>~340G+ for <em>home</em> partition (leave last sector unspecified in fdisk to use all remaining space)</li>
</ul>
<p>We are aiming for a partition layout similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0   200M  0 part /boot
├─sda2   8:2    0    24G  0 part [SWAP]
├─sda3   8:3    0   100G  0 part /
└─sda4   8:4    0 341.6G  0 part /home
</code></pre>
<h2 id="format-partitions-file-systems">Format partitions (file systems)</h2>
<p>Apply <code>ext4</code> (the fourth extended filesystem) to the boot, root and home partitions (i.e. all but the swap):</p>
<pre><code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4
</code></pre>
<p>Then setup the swap space:</p>
<pre><code>mkswap /dev/sda2
swapon /dev/sda2
</code></pre>
<p>Now its time to mount these new partitions into the Arch bootstrapped system, so they be used.</p>
<p>The four partitions will be mounted into the current Arch boot preparation systems file system tree under <code>/mnt</code> so a <code>chroot</code> can occur, and then system installation. First mount the root partition, then the <em>boot</em> and <em>home</em> partitions within the <em>root</em> mount under <code>/mnt/boot</code> and <code>/mnt/home</code> respectively.</p>
<pre><code>mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/boot /mnt/home
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/home
</code></pre>
<h2 id="setup-pacman-mirrors">Setup pacman mirrors</h2>
<p>Defined in <code>/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</code>. Higher mirrors in the list taken precedence over lower once, rearrange as desired:</p>
<pre><code>##
## Arch Linux repository mirrorlist
## Filtered by mirror score from mirror status page
## Generated on 2019-04-01
##

## Australia
Server = http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch
## Turkey
Server = http://mirror.veriteknik.net.tr/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch
</code></pre>
<h2 id="install-arch-with-pacstrap">Install Arch with pacstrap</h2>
<p>The <code>pacstrap</code> script will install the <code>base</code>, and if desired other <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/">package groups</a>, such as <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/base-devel/">base-devel</a> for common build related programs.</p>
<pre><code>pacstrap /mnt base base-devel
</code></pre>
<h2 id="fstab">fstab</h2>
<p>So that the mount are automatically applied as part of the system boot process, add them to <code>/etc/fstab</code> as UUID&rsquo;s, which are more robust than device names which can change.</p>
<pre><code>genfstab -U /mnt &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/fstab
</code></pre>
<h2 id="chroot">chroot</h2>
<p>Now to change root into the new system, from the Arch boot preparation system:</p>
<pre><code>arch-chroot /mnt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="root-password">root password</h2>
<p>Set the password for the root account with <code>passwd</code></p>
<h2 id="localisation">Localisation</h2>
<p>Uncomment <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> and <code>UTF-8</code> in <code>/etc/locale.gen</code>, and generate:</p>
<pre><code>locale-gen
</code></pre>
<p>Create <code>/etc/locale.conf</code> with:</p>
<pre><code>LANG=en_US.UTF-8
</code></pre>
<h2 id="time-zone">Time zone</h2>
<p>Symlink in the appropriate zone definition:</p>
<pre><code>ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Canberra /etc/localtime
</code></pre>
<p>Run <code>hwclock --systohc</code> to generate <code>/etc/adjtime</code></p>
<h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create <code>/etc/hostname</code>, and define a name for the host.</li>
<li>Edit <code>/etc/hosts</code> for loopback based on the defined hostname above, <code>127.0.1.1 myhostname.localdomain myhostname</code></li>
<li>Install NetworkManager which provides persistent network configuration across reboots, <code>pacman -S networkmanager</code> and enable it <code>systemctl enable NetworkManager</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="boot-loader-grub">Boot loader (GRUB)</h2>
<p>Several boot loaders are <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_boot_process#Boot_loader">supported</a> but here are going with GRUB.</p>
<pre><code>pacman -S grub
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
</code></pre>
<p>A minimal base system is installed and configured, and ready to be used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Escape chroot with ctrl+d or <code>exit</code>.</li>
<li>Unmount everything <code>umount -R /mnt</code>, <code>lsblk</code> should confirm this.</li>
<li><code>reboot</code></li>
<li>Remove the USB drive</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wifi">Wifi</h2>
<p>Unfortunately wifi settings were not persisted. Fix with network manager:</p>
<pre><code>nmcli dev wifi connect wifi-sid-goes-here password wifi-password-goes-here
</code></pre>
<p>Also make sure to that <code>wifi-menu</code> is functional, by installing the <code>dialog</code> package. <code>netctl</code> is useful for troubleshooting. Ensure that the network profile for the wifi is enabled using <code>netctl</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#nmcli_examples">archwiki</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nmcli device wifi list</code> sniff currently available wifi ssids in range</li>
<li><code>nmcli connection show</code> show active connection/s</li>
<li><code>nmcli device wifi connect Jeneffer password S3CR3T</code> connect to ssid</li>
<li><code>nmcli device wifi connect Jeneffer password S3CR3T hidden yes</code> connect to hidden ssid</li>
<li><code>nmcli connection up uuid UUID</code> reconnect a disconnected interface</li>
<li><code>nmcli device</code> list all interfaces and their state</li>
<li><code>mcli device disconnect wlp3s0</code> disconnect an interface</li>
<li><code>nmcli radio wifi off</code> disable wifi radio</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="add-users">Add users</h2>
<pre><code>useradd -m -g wheel ben
passwd ben
sudo vi /etc/sudoers
</code></pre>
<p>Uncomment (line 85) to allow members of the wheel group to sudo with (or without) password prompting:</p>
<pre><code>%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
</code></pre>
<h2 id="gpu-drivers">GPU drivers</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a mix of machines with nvidia and amd accelerators. Just follow the bouncing ball on the appropriate arch wiki:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AMDGPU">AMDGPU</a> for the open source AMD based driver</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA">NVIDIA</a> the proprietary blob</li>
</ul>
<p>Once installed verify with some benchmarks, before installing steam. Install <code>glmark2</code> from the AUR, then bench.</p>

<h2 id="desktop-environment-de-vs-window-manager-wm">Desktop Environment (DE) vs Window Manager (WM)</h2>
<p>In a nutshell a DE (like gnome or kde) is heavy weight includes everything bar the kitchen sink, such as music players, document editors, file managers, status bars, network managers, start menus, etc. They are incredibly bloated, but aimed at novice users that just want their computer &ldquo;to work&rdquo;. A WM (like dwm or i3) on the other hand is incredibly lean, I mean you don&rsquo;t even get a status bar, but are very customisable and do just what you want and no more. Because of this WM&rsquo;s tend to be allot snappier. I personally prefer using a WM, and more specifically a tiling WM (aka a <em>tiler</em>) and highly recommend <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because dwm is customized through editing its source code [C], it&rsquo;s pointless to make binary packages of it. This keeps its userbase small and elitist. No novices asking stupid questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have started to form some of my own opinions around the use of a tiler:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaps between windows are literally a waste of space. Don&rsquo;t do this.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t bother with lots of the cosmetic ricing hacks out there, its all bloat.</li>
<li>Toolbars (such as <code>polybar</code>) display redundant information at the cost of cognitive overload and wasted screen real-estate. If I want to know the time I look at my watch.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dwm">dwm</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve have recently discovered <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless</a>, and their <a href="https://suckless.org/philosophy/">philosophy</a> towards software really resonates strongly with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are the home of quality software such as dwm, dmenu, st and plenty of other tools, with a focus on simplicity, clarity and frugality. Our philosophy is about keeping things simple, minimal and usable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>dwm</code> is their minimal tiling window manager.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because dwm is customized through editing its source code, it&rsquo;s pointless to make binary packages of it. This keeps its userbase small and elitist. No novices asking stupid questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom <code>config.h</code>, by editing the <code>config.def.h</code> header, and (re)compiling the source code using the provided makefile.</p>
<pre><code>pacman -Sy xorg-server xorg-xinit
pacman -Sy xf86-video-amdgpu
pacman -Sy dmenu git
</code></pre>
<p>Clone the <code>dwm</code> Git repo, and my patches:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
git clone https://github.com/bm4cs/dots.git
cd ~/dotfiles &amp;&amp; ./install.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Apply <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/">patches</a> for specific features wanted. The only patch I apply is <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/center/">center</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add an iscentered rule to automatically center clients on the current monitor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lets you define rules in <code>config.def.h</code> for certain programs (e.g. pulsemixer) that you&rsquo;d like to launch center screen, by adding an <code>iscentered</code> rule to automatically center clients on the current monitor:</p>
<pre><code>static const Rule rules[] = {
    /* xprop(1):
     *	WM_CLASS(STRING) = instance, class
     *	WM_NAME(STRING) = title
     */
    /* class      instance       title       tags mask     iscentered     isfloating   monitor */
    { &quot;Gimp&quot;,     NULL,          NULL,       0,            0,             1,           -1 },
</code></pre>
<p>To you can see the <code>WM_CLASS</code> and <code>WM_NAME</code> properties of the X window are used by the rule chain to figure out what rules to apply. To determine these values, use <code>xprop</code> which will give you a mouse cursor to select the window of the running program you are interested in, and will dump its property to stdout:</p>
<pre><code>$ xprop WM_CLASS
WM_CLASS(STRING) = &quot;st-256color&quot;, &quot;st-256color&quot;

$ xprop WM_CLASS
WM_CLASS(STRING) = &quot;st-256color&quot;, &quot;st-256color&quot;

$ xprop WM_NAME
WM_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = &quot;vim&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Build and install:</p>
<pre><code>make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>To autostart <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<p>Edit <code>~/.xinitrc</code> with following:</p>
<pre><code>exec dwm
</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>startx</code>. A black screen desktop should appear. This is good.</p>
<h3 id="i3-gaps">i3-gaps</h3>
<p><code>i3-gaps</code> is a fork of the excellent <code>i3wm</code> tiling window manager. As its name implies it supports placing gaps (i.e. regions of space) between the tiled windows, providing a very neat and satisfying perception of order when windows are automatically laid out.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bencode.net/images/i3-snap.jpg" alt="i3-gaps in action" title="i3-gaps in action"></p>

<p>Edit <code>~/.xinitrc</code> with following:</p>
<pre><code>exec i3

<pre><code>xdg-mime query default text/plain

<p>Or, if unsure of the MIME type, to check a default program based on a sample input file:</p>
<pre><code>xdg-mime query filetype 2016-01-12-jdbc-overflow.markdown

<p>Then bind it as the default for a given file (MIME) type:</p>
<pre><code>xdg-mime default nvim.desktop text/plain
</code></pre>
<p>Test it out:</p>
<pre><code>xdg-open 2018-01-08-pki.markdown

            <description>10 Reasons Why Linux Is Better Than Windows It is often seen that people get confused over choosing Windows or Linux as a host operating system in both server and desktop spaces. People will focus on aspects of cost, the functionality provided, hardware compatibility, support, reliability, security, pre-built software, cloud-readiness, etc. before they finalize. In this regard, this article covers ten reasons for using Linux over Windows.
10 Reasons Why Linux Is Better Than Windows 1.</description>

<p>It is often seen that people get confused over choosing Windows or Linux as a host operating system in both server and desktop spaces. People will focus on aspects of cost, the functionality provided, hardware compatibility, support, reliability, security, pre-built software, cloud-readiness, etc. before they finalize. In this regard, this article covers ten reasons for using Linux over Windows.</p>
<h2 id="10-reasons-why-linux-is-better-than-windows-1">10 Reasons Why Linux Is Better Than Windows</h2>
<h3 id="1-total-cost-of-ownership">1. Total cost of ownership</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linux-less-costly-than-windows.jpg" alt="linux less costly than windows">!</p>
<p>The most obvious advantage is that Linux is free whereas Windows is not.  Windows license cost is different for both desktop and server versions.  In the case of Linux OS either it can be desktop or server, distro comes with no cost.  Not only the OS even the related applications are completely free and <a href="http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/open-source-vs-closed-source">open source</a>.</p>
<p>For personal use, a single Windows OS license fee may appear inexpensive but when considered for business, more employees mean more cost.  Not only the OS license cost, but the organization also needs to be ready to pay for applications like MS Office, Exchange, SharePoint that run on Windows.</p>
<p>In Windows world, you cannot modify the OS as its source code is not open source. The same is the case with proprietary applications running on it. However, in case of Linux, a user can download even the source code of a Linux OS, change it and use it spending no money.  Though some Linux distros charge for support, they are inexpensive when compared to Windows license price.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linux-mint-easy-to-use.jpg" alt="linux mint easy to use">
Windows OS is one of the simplest desktop OS available today.  Its graphical user-friendliness is exceptional. Though Windows has a relatively minimal learning curve, Linux distros like Ubuntu, Elementary OS, Linux Mint, etc. are striving to improve the user experience that makes the transition from Windows to Linux become smooth and easy.</p>
<p>Linux distros allow the user to choose one of the various desktop environments available: Cinnamon, MATE, KDE, Xfce, LXDE, GNOME, etc. If a Windows user is looking to migrate to Linux, <a href="http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/how-to-install-wine-and-run-windows-apps-in-linux">WINE</a> (Wine Is Not an Emulator) can be installed to have a feel of MS Windows on a Linux system.</p>
<h3 id="3-reliability">3. Reliability</h3>
<p>Linux is more reliable when compared to Windows. Linux will rock with its top-notch design, built-in security resulting un-parallel up-time.  Developers of Linux distros are much active and release major and minor updates from time to time.</p>
<p>Traditionally Unix-like systems are known for running for years without a single failure or having a situation that demands a restart. This is an important factor especially choosing a server system.  Definitely Linux being a UNIX-like system, it will be a better choice.</p>
<h3 id="4-hardware">4. Hardware</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linux-better-hardware-support.jpg" alt="linux better hardware support">
Linux systems are known for consuming fewer system resources (RAM, disk space, etc.) when compared to Windows.  Hardware vendors already realized the popularity of Linux and started making Linux compliant hardware/drivers. When running the OS on older hardware, Windows is slower.</p>
<p>Linux distros like Lubuntu, Knoppix, LXLE, antiX, Puppy Linux are best suitable for aging machines.  Old horses like 386 or 486 machines with decent RAM (&gt;= 124/256) can run Linux.</p>
<h3 id="5-software">5. Software</h3>
<p>No doubt that Windows has a large set of commercial software available.  Linux, on the other hand, makes use of open source software available for free.  Linux armed with easy to use package managers which aid in installing and un-installing desired software applications. Linux is armed with decent desktop themes certainly run faster than Windows.</p>
<p>For developers, the Linux terminal offers a superior environment when compared to Windows.  The exhaustive GNU compilers and utilities will be definitely useful for programming. Administrators can make use of package managers to manage software and of course, Linux has the unbeatable CLI interface.</p>
<p>Have you heard about Tiny Core Linux? It comes at only 11MB size with a graphical desktop environment.  You can choose to install from the hundreds of available Linux distros based on your needs.</p>
<p>Following table presents a partial list of Linux distros filtered based on need:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linux-vast-software-support.png" alt="linux vast software support">!</p>
<h3 id="6-security">6. Security</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linux-is-more-secure-than-windows.jpg" alt="linux is more secure than windows">!</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows OS is infamous for being vulnerable to malware, trojans, and viruses.  Linux is almost non-vulnerable and more secure due to its inherent design. Linux does not require the use of commercial anti-virus/anti-malware packages.Linux respects privacy. Unlike windows, it does not generate logs and upload data from your machine. A user should be well aware of Windows privacy policy.</p>
<h3 id="7-freedom">7. Freedom</h3>
<p>Linux can be installed and used it as a desktop, firewall, a file server, or a web server.  Linux allows a user to control every aspect of the operating systems. As Linux is an open-source operating system, it allows a user to modify its source (even source code of applications) itself as per the user requirements.</p>
<p>Linux allows the user to install only the desired software nothing else (no bloatware). Linux allows full freedom to install open source applications its vast repository. Windows will bore you with its default desktop theme whereas with Linux you can choose from many desktop themes available.​You can breathe fresh air after choosing a Linux distro from an available list of Linux distros.</p>
<p>With USB live-mode option, you can give a try to test a Linux distro before you finalize one for you.  Booting via live-mode does not install the OS on a hard disk. Just go and give a try, you will fall in love.</p>
<h3 id="8-annoying-crashes-and-reboots">8. Annoying crashes and reboots</h3>
<p>There are times when Windows suddenly shows an annoying message saying that the machine needs to be restarted. Apart from showing &ldquo;Applying update of 5 of 361.&rdquo; kind messages,  Windows will confuse you with several types of updates critical, security, definition, update rollup, service pack, tool, feature pack.  I did not remember how many times the Windows rebooted last time to apply an update.</p>
<p>When undergoing a software update or installing/uninstalling software on Linux systems, generally it does not need a machine reboot.  Most of the system configuration changes can be done while the system is up.</p>
<h3 id="9-server-segment">9. Server segment</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linux-server.jpg" alt="linux server"></p>
<p>Linux is installed on the majority of servers demonstrating that it is the best choice with a minimal resource footprint. Even rivals are using Linux on their offerings. As software applications are moving to cloud platforms, windows servers are getting phased out to make room for Linux servers. Majority of the supercomputers run on Linux.</p>
<p>Though the battle between Linux and Windows continues in desktop-segment when it comes to server-segment Linux evolves as a clear winner. Organizations rely on servers because they want their applications to run 24x7x365 with no or limited downtime. Linux already became favorite of most of the datacenters.</p>
<h3 id="10-linux-is-everywhere">10. Linux is everywhere</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/linux-is-everywhere.jpg" alt="linux is everywhere"></p>
<p>Yes, Linux is everywhere. From the smallest device to the largest supercomputer, Linux is everywhere.  It can be a car, router, phone, medical devices, plane, TV, satellite, watch or school tablet, Linux will be there.</p>
<p>The inventor Linus Torvalds himself would not have imagined about this kind of success when he was writing the Linux kernel first time. Kudos to Linus and Stallman for their contribution.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a saying – variety is the spice of life.  It is true with respect to Linux distros.  There are more than 600 active different distros to choose from. Each is different on its own and meant for a specific purpose. Linux distros are highly customizable when compared to Windows.  The above reasons mentioned are is just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more than you could with Linux. Linux is powerful, flexible, secure, reliable, stable, fun… than Windows. One should always keep in mind that – free is not the best just like expensive is not the best.</p>
<p>Linux will undoubtedly emerge as the winner when all aspects are considered. There is no reason why you would not choose Linux instead of Windows.  Let us know your thoughts on how you feel about Linux.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="best-linux-distros-for-gaming">Best Linux Distros for Gaming</h1>
<p>There are so many Linux distributions for gamers you would find today. If you’re confused with all the options you could choose from, we got you covered.</p>
<p>We’ve compiled a list to help you pick the best Linux distro for your gaming preference and needs.</p>
<h3 id="1-steam-os">1. Steam OS</h3>
<p>Let’s start the list off with Steam OS. This is one of the most popular gaming distros today. This is because this is developed and maintained by Valve.</p>
<p>This is based on the Debian 8 OS and it utilizes the GNOME desktop environment. To make it convenient for gamers, this supports various types of joysticks, gamepads, and graphics cards upon installation. You can go ahead and manually install the driver for your hardware if it’s not supported.</p>
<p>Installing Steam OS comes pre-installed with Steam and tons of games from the Steam Store. Everything is designed and perfected with gaming in mind so there’s no need for you to install anything else to play games on Steam.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not recommended if you have an older rig because of the high hardware requirements. But for gaming enthusiasts, there’s nothing more you could ask for.</p>
<h3 id="2-ubuntu-gamepack">2. Ubuntu GamePack</h3>
<p>Another Linux distro that’s perfect for us gamers is Ubuntu GamePack. This is not the usual Ubuntu but is rather based on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>The thing about Ubuntu GamePack is the fact that this doesn’t have any games preinstalled like the Steam OS. However, this comes preinstalled with the Steam client, Wine, PlayOnLinux, and Lutris. It’s like a crossroads where games on Linux, Windows, Console, and Steam can be played.</p>
<p>This makes it a hybrid OS in a sense, especially since this also supports Oracle Java and Adobe Flash. This means playing online games is also possible. In fact, there are over 6 thousand Linux and Windows games that are guaranteed to launch in Ubuntu GamePack.</p>
<p>If you’ve tried the Ubuntu in the past and you’re comfortable with it, go with this distro.</p>
<h3 id="3-fedora-games-spin">3. Fedora Games Spin</h3>
<p>If it’s games that you’re after, this is the OS for you. Fedora Games Spin is designed for gamers. The fact that there are thousands of games that come pre-installed and tools to install more is what makes it worth getting or even trying.</p>
<p>The games that come pre-installed range from first-person shooters, real-time and turn-based strategy games, and more. If that doesn’t attract a gamer, I don’t know what does.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the Linux distros, this is fast, light, and stable.</p>
<p>If you wish to have PlayOnLinux, Wine, or Steam games, you need to have them installed manually since they don’t come pre-installed by default. Aside from that, you also need new drivers installed since it doesn’t come with the installation.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a gaming Linux distro and you’re comfortable with the XFCE desktop environment, this is perfect for you.</p>
<h3 id="4-sparkylinux--gameover-edition">4. SparkyLinux – Gameover Edition</h3>
<p>If you’re a gamer who’s into playing games on emulators, SparkyLinux – Gameover Edition is for you.</p>
<p>They already have a ton of pre-installed games that you could play with but the APTus Gamer program offers you with even more options to play. This contains a list of emulators that you could install on your system. However, if you wish to play games on Steam, PlayOnLinux, or Wine, you need to have them manually installed since they don’t come pre-installed.</p>
<p>Overall, if you’re an avid gamer inclined towards playing games on an emulator, it’s a game over once you install the SparkyLinux – Gameover edition.</p>
<h3 id="5-lakka-os">5. Lakka OS</h3>
<p>Literal console in a PC – this is what Lakka OS is about. This has no desktop environment like the rest of the Linux distros you would find.</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s light and doesn’t really need a powerful rig. Unlike SparkyLinux – Gameover Edition where you need to manually install the emulators, Lakka OS has tons of pre-installed emulators at your disposal.</p>
<p>Go with SparkyLinux – Gameover Edition if you wish to play games on an emulator and occasionally play other games on Steam or PlayOnLinux. However, if you wish to go full-time gaming on an emulator, you won’t regret installing Lakka OS.</p>
<h3 id="6-manjaro-gaming-edition">6. Manjaro Gaming Edition</h3>
<p>The Manjaro Gaming Edition is dedicated to gamers who are inclined towards content creation. We could say that this is for gamers who are into content creation since this comes pre-installed with tools for creating content.</p>
<p>Some of these include Audacity, streaming apps, screenshot tools, chatting software, and more.</p>
<p>One of the things that make Manjaro an OS you should consider is the fact that this comes pre-installed with popular graphics card drivers. They aren’t just updated regularly but can be optimized for a better gaming experience.</p>
<p>This also comes pre-installed with emulators such as Dolphin, DOSbox, FCEUX, Kega Fusion, PCSX, PCSX2, PPSSPP, RetroArch, Stella, VBA-M, Yabause, and ZSNES. If you want to stream your gaming experience on these emulators, Manjaro Gaming Edition will be perfect.</p>
<p>The only problem with this distro is the fact that this is an Arch Linux based distro. If you want to play steam games, you need to have the Steam client manually installed first. But because Steam client isn’t supported by Arch, there will be problems here and there.</p>
<p>In general, gamers who are into content creation will surely find this OS perfect.</p>
<h3 id="7-solus">7. Solus</h3>
<p>This is a unique type of Linux distro because compared to the rest of the distros, this isn’t based on Arch Linux, Ubuntu, and Debian. Instead, this is a Linux OS that’s made from scratch.</p>
<p>What makes this great is the fact that you get to choose from the 3 desktop environments you’re already comfortable with:</p>
<p>GNOME</p>
<p>Mate</p>
<p>Budgie</p>
<p>There’s no difference between the three and you could choose whichever environment works out for you.</p>
<p>It has a modern touch to it compared to the rest of it’s Linux distro brethren. It almost has everything you need right out of the box and this comes pre-installed with programs you could use for general home use, browsing, and gaming.</p>
<p>To top that off, you get the latest versions of drivers and software with Solus.</p>
<p>But like the Steam OS, you need a more powerful rig to run this OS.</p>
<p>Steps to Choosing the Right Gaming Linux Distro for You
Before you decide which Linux distro you’d install, it’s very important that you know what factors matter and which features you need to prioritize.</p>
<p>We’ve listed important items that you need to consider before you make a selection. Check these out to make it easier for you to choose the right one for your gaming preference.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-needs">Know Your Needs</h3>
<p>You need to know what your needs are. As a gamer, you should have an idea of what types of games you play.</p>
<p>If you wish to solely play games on an emulator, then go ahead and get the Lakka OS. If you’re solely into steam games, either you get a Steam OS, Ubuntu GamePack, or Solus.</p>
<p>However, if you’re more inclined towards creating content from gaming through streaming, editing videos, and content, then I’d personally recommend you get Manjaro Gaming Edition. This comes pre-installed with the tools you need to get you started in no time.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-environment">Desktop Environment</h3>
<p>Remember that these Linux distros have desktop environments that differ from each other. Make sure you look into this before you make any selection. Most gamers take this seriously and are meticulous about it but there also are those who aren’t that picky.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it all boils down to which distro matches your preferences. In case you’re very picky about this regard, I suggest you start with Solus and work your way to the rest of the list.</p>
<h3 id="stability-cutting-edge-and-release-cycle">Stability, Cutting Edge, and Release Cycle</h3>
<p>There are Linux distributions that regularly updates the version. To take note of this matter is very important, especially if you’re a newbie.</p>
<p>This could lead to disappointments down the line if you don’t take this seriously. When choosing, make sure you check the stability of the distribution and see how often they release a new update or version. Doing so should secure you’re choosing the right one for you.</p>
<h3 id="system-requirement-and-compatibility">System Requirement and Compatibility</h3>
<p>Remember that not all distros are the same. Even though these are all designed for gamers, there are specific hardware requirements that need to be met.</p>
<p>Take Steam OS as an example. This needs a powerful gaming rig to run it effectively. You can check the system requirements from their respective websites and online resources that talk about the 7 Best Linux Gaming Distributions.</p>
<h3 id="community-and-support">Community and Support</h3>
<p>Lastly, don’t forget that there are so many communities out there that talk about this topic. Being able to go over and reach out to professionals and geeks in the industry is one way to ensure you get to choose the right one for you.</p>
<p>You can rely on It’s FOSS as a start.</p>
<p>Being able to read and gather more data about the list we have is one way for you to make the best selection at the end of the day.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="dual-boot-linux-mint-20-and-windows-10">Dual Boot Linux Mint 20 and Windows 10</h1>
<p>With recent rapid increases in information technology, every user wants to customize their operating system environment according to their needs. Today, we will talk about the most popular Linux Mint 20 distribution, known as Ulyana. Linux Mint is an open-source, flexible, community-based Linux operating system in which you can customize operating environments and applications on-demand. As compared to Windows, Linux Mint is a much more secure platform. Sometimes, developers who work on Windows may also require the Linux platform to perform their daily development tasks. For this purpose, it is easy to install the Linux Mint 20 along with Microsoft Windows OS.</p>
<p>This article shows you how to install Linux Mint 20 along with Microsoft Windows 10. In this tutorial, we assumed that Windows 10 is already installed on your system. We will use the existing system to dual boot the Linux Mint 20 distro and the Windows 10 OS. Certain modern systems have UEFI in place of BIOS, and in this case, you would change the EFI configuration settings and disable the secure boot part.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>The following prerequisites are necessary to install Linux Mint 20 with Windows 10 on your system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your system should be connected to a power supply.</li>
<li>Your system must have a good internet connection to download the supporting software and updates.</li>
<li>The free space on your disk should be at least 15GB to install Linux Mint 20, which is larger than the space taken by this OS because more space will be needed for upcoming system updates.</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20 ISO version burned to a USB drive.</li>
<li>A Windows 10 bootable live USB (for preventive measures).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Windows 10 must be installed before the installation of Linux Mint 20 can begin.</p>
<p>Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, you can now begin installing Linux Mint 20 with Windows 10. Follow the steps below to install Linux Mint 20 alongside Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-backup-of-your-system">Create A Backup of Your System</h3>
<p>First, you must create a backup of your USB data and Windows 10 so that no data is lost in the process. Adding a new system can mess with the new environment. For your convenience, it is recommended that you save your data on an external hard drive. It is recommended to create a Windows 10 backup so that, in case of any trouble, you can run the default backup of your Windows 10 and your data will be safe from harm.</p>
<h3 id="download-the-iso-file-of-linux-mint-20">Download the ISO File of Linux Mint 20</h3>
<p>Next, download the Linux Mint 20 ISO file. To do so, open the browser and type the URL . Download the ISO file from the given URL.</p>
<p><img src="https://linuxhint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/word-image-1196.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After successfully completing the download process, now, you will create a bootable USB to install Linux Mint 20.</p>
<h3 id="make-a-bootable-usb-drive">Make a Bootable USB Drive</h3>
<p>To make a bootable USB drive, we will use a tool known as &ldquo;RUFUS.&rdquo; This section shows you how to download Rufus and how to create a bootable USB drive with this tool. First, you will need to format the USB drive. Make sure that your USB is in FAT32 format. If it is not, then first, you will convert the USB into FAT32 and apply the format option on it.</p>

            <description>Plagiarism in Free Software Note: the opinions expressed here are solely mine. (Duh)
Something that I take rather seriously is the copying and redistibution without credit (intentionally or otherwise) of free software, i.e. plagiarism.
There&amp;rsquo;s a huge difference between something being in the public domain and being free and open source. The latter has a license, for one, and the purpose of it being under license is to preserve the rights of the author(s) to their work(s) but some people either misunderstand or ignore that distinction.</description>

<p>Something that I take rather seriously is the copying and redistibution without credit (intentionally or otherwise) of free software, i.e. plagiarism.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Now it must be said that most people generally abide by the licensing of free software projects but I&rsquo;ve come across and been personally affected by instances when folks simply copy some works and remove or replace the original license during redistribution and modification (usually unbeknownst to the original author) and thereby take credit and this is unconscionable in my view. People put free software licenses on their works in good faith and there is a general expectation that the larger community also acts in good faith when modifying works but the onus is still on us to exert our rights otherwise the license loses its effectiveness and free software is lesser for it.</p>
<p>All that said, in my experience this kind of plagiarism occurs on a pretty small scale on projects with one or a few authors—no one&rsquo;s out there copying the entire Linux kernel and passing it off as their own work—but if we are to be good advocates of free software we also have to be guardians of it regardless. We need to hold plagiarists accountable for their actions or at least call them out on it.</p>

            <description>10 Things To Do After Installing Linux Welcome to Linux! So you&amp;rsquo;ve found [a site][1], read some blog or other online article that tells you that switching to Linux is worthwhile and you&amp;rsquo;ve made the switch. So of course you&amp;rsquo;re now asking yourself &amp;ldquo;what are the next ten things that I should to do?&amp;rdquo; which is understandable because that&amp;rsquo;s what we all do when we start using something unfamiliar to us.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="10-things-to-do-after-installing-linux">10 Things To Do After Installing Linux</h1>
<h2 id="welcome-to-linux">Welcome to Linux!</h2>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve found [a site][1], read some blog or other online article that tells you that switching to Linux is worthwhile and you&rsquo;ve made the switch. So of course you&rsquo;re now asking yourself &ldquo;what are the next ten things that I should to do?&rdquo; which is understandable because that&rsquo;s what we all do when we start using something unfamiliar to us.</p>
<p>![Tux][2]</p>
<p>Often are still some tasks you can perform to make your computer even more efficient, productive, and enjoyable –each of which will help you master the Linux operating system.</p>
<p>So without further ado, here are my top ten things that you <em>absolutely</em> have to do as new user to Linux.</p>
<h3 id="1-learn-to-use-the-terminal">1. Learn to Use the Terminal</h3>
<p>While the desktop environment that you just dove into is likely well usable and capable, the terminal is the only true way to use Linux. So find and pop open that terminal app and start typing random words or pasting commands you read about online into it to learn what&rsquo;s what.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cd</code> –tells you about a random CD that you may have never heard before.</li>
<li><code>sudo</code> –this actually a game that&rsquo;s a short version of sudoku (see, &ldquo;sudo&rdquo; is the first 4 letters) you only need to fill a single row with the numbers 1-9</li>
<li><code>ls</code> –for listing things, for example <code>ls vegetables</code> lists all vegetables.</li>
<li><code>cat</code> –generates a cat picture randomly on your computer, for you to find later as a surprise.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-add-various-repositories-with-untested-software">2. Add Various Repositories with Untested Software</h3>
<p>Any experienced Linux user knows that the best way to use the latest software is to not trust the repostories that your operating system is built on and to start adding extra repositories that other people are suggesting online. Regardless of which system you&rsquo;ve started with, it&rsquo;s going to involve adding or editing extra text files as an adminstrator, which is <em>completely</em> safe.</p>
<h3 id="3-play-none-of-your-media">3. Play None of Your Media</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ll learn that on Linux you can&rsquo;t play any of music or video library because we Linux users are morally against the media cartel and their evil decoding software. So you may as well delete all that media you&rsquo;ve collected –this&rsquo;ll give you tonnes of space for compiling the kernel. But if you must listen to your Taylor Swift collection, there&rsquo;s [totally immoral codecs][3] you can download.</p>
<h3 id="4-give-up-on-wi-fi">4. Give up on Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>Pull that wi-fi card out of your computer, you don&rsquo;t need it (not that it works anyway with Linux) and hook yourself up to Ethernet. Besides, you can get quite long lengths of cable for cheap on [Amazon][4]. Running cable is the best. I don&rsquo;t miss wifi at all…</p>
<h3 id="5-learn-another-desktop">5. Learn Another Desktop</h3>
<p>Just getting the hang of this newfangled desktop interface and it&rsquo;s not working out? Ditch it and install a different one. Of course each desktop&rsquo;s respective development teams have totally collaborated so there&rsquo;s some continuity and common elements that will allow you to easily switch between them without confusion.</p>
<h3 id="6-install-java">6. Install Java</h3>
<p>Like on Windows and OS X, you have to download install Java on Linux for reasons unclear. We don&rsquo;t really know any better than Windows or Mac users why we need it either, but at least on Linux it&rsquo;s much easier to install: [see here][5].</p>
<h3 id="7-fix-something">7. Fix Something</h3>
<p>Just to keep you on your toes Linux comes with some trivial bug or issue that you have to fix yourself. It&rsquo;s not that the developers can&rsquo;t fix it themselves, there&rsquo;s just an tradition of having new users fix something as a rite of passage. Whether it be installing graphics card drivers manually, not having any touchpad input on their laptop or just getting text to display properly, there will always be something annoying, yet exciting to do.</p>
<h3 id="8-compile-the-kernel">8. Compile the Kernel</h3>
<p>Whatever version of the the Linux kernel came with your system is almost immediately out-of-date because kernel development is so fast, so you&rsquo;re going to have to learn to compile the kernel yourself to update it periodically. I won&rsquo;t go into it here, but there&rsquo;s a great guide [here][6] that you can follow.</p>
<h3 id="9-remove-the-root-filesystem">9. Remove the Root Filesystem</h3>
<p>Oh yeah, since you only need your home folder and because the root filesystem is mostly filled with needless software it&rsquo;s best to remove the it. So open a terminal and paste or type: <code>sudo rm -rf /</code>.</p>
<p>Just kidding, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<h3 id="10-change-your-wallpaper">10. Change Your Wallpaper</h3>
<p>Umm, I&rsquo;m running out of ideas but I have to fill out this list so: change your desktop&rsquo;s background to something cool I guess.</p>
<h3 id="beyond">Beyond</h3>
<p>So there you have it, ten essential things you should do to be well on your way to becoming a master Linux user.</p>
<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t gotten the joke yet, this is a parody. ;)</p>

            <description>Note: to do this, all your chromeOS data will be wiped. I recommend reading through all of this post before starting.
This post is about how I got my chromebook dual booting galliumOS.
Step one: go into Developer mode. Developer mode is a setting that lets you do development. It&amp;rsquo;s not on by default because it also makes it easier to install a malicious package. (APKs, or android packages, can&amp;rsquo;t be opened without developer mode.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note</strong>: to do this, all your chromeOS data will be wiped. I recommend reading through all of this post before starting.</p>
<p>This post is about how I got my chromebook dual booting galliumOS.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-go-into-developer-mode">Step one: go into Developer mode.</h3>
<p>Developer mode is a setting that lets you do development. It&rsquo;s not on by default because it also makes it easier to install a malicious package. (APKs, or android packages, can&rsquo;t be opened without developer mode.)</p>
<p>To turn on developer mode, hold down the esc and reload key, then tap the power key. You will be greeted by a very scary popup saying &ldquo;CHROMEOS IS MISSING OR DAMAGED.&rdquo; Hit control-D, and then it will say something along the lines of &ldquo;START DEVELOPER MODE? all your data will be wiped.&rdquo; press enter. It will start.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-login">Step two: login</h3>
<p>Your computer will restart and say &ldquo;OS VERIFICATION IS OFF.&rdquo; Press control-D.</p>
<p>since starting Developer mode wiped all your data, you will have to log in again, etc. If you don&rsquo;t want to that, you can just go into guest mode.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-install-chrx">Step two: install Chrx</h3>
<p>You will have to install and run Chrx, which is really easy. Just one curl command:</p>
<pre><code>cd ; curl -Os https://chrx.org/go &amp;&amp; sh go
</code></pre><p>Copy and paste that command in chrosh shell (ctrl-alt-T and then type shell.)</p>
<p>Go through the install script. At the bottom, it will have a &ldquo;diagnosis.&rdquo; If it says it will only succeed if it has a firmware update keep that in mind. Reboot.</p>
<h2 id="step-twotwo-update-firmware">Step two.two: Update firmware</h2>
<p>If you need to update your firmware, you will have to download MrChromebox. Type this in the crosh shell:</p>
<pre><code>cd; curl -LO https://mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh &amp;&amp; sudo bash firmware-util.sh 
</code></pre><p>You will see a menu.</p>
<p>Press 1 to update the firmware. (When you do this, you will install BIOS [Basic Input/Output System]).</p>
<h3 id="step-three-repeat-step-six">Step three: repeat &ldquo;step six&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Type this command in chrosh (again):</p>
<pre><code>cd ; curl -Os https://chrx.org/go &amp;&amp; sh go 
</code></pre><p>That will install GaliumOS.</p>
<h3 id="step-four-get-into-galliumos">Step four: Get into GalliumOS</h3>
<p>Reboot. This time, when you have to type control-D, type control-L. It will go into BIOS, then GalliumOS. Username is chrx and password is chrx.</p>
<p>Other chrx info:</p>
<p><strong>chrx</strong> can accept several command-line options:</p>
<pre><code>Usage: chrx [ option ... ]

<h3 id="packages">packages</h3>
<p><strong>chrx</strong> can install additional software packages after installing
your new operating system, using the <code>-p PACKAGE</code> option.</p>
<p>You can install any package in the Ubuntu repositories via this
method, plus a few non-Ubuntu packages for which <strong>chrx</strong> has
special handling, and some aliases for convenience:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>minecraft</code> installs <a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a></li>
<li><code>steam</code> installs <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">Steam</a></li>
<li><code>kodi</code> installs <a href="http://kodi.tv/about/">Kodi Media Center</a></li>
<li><code>chrome</code> installs Google Chrome</li>
<li><code>admin-misc</code> is an alias for <code>&quot;ssh tmux rsync vim&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>dev-misc</code> is an alias for <code>&quot;arduino geany geany-plugins ruby&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>To install multiple packages from the <strong>chrx</strong> command line, you
can repeat the <code>-p PACKAGE</code> option as many times as you need, or
you can quote the argument, e.g.: <code>-p &quot;gimp blender inkscape&quot;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="examples">examples</h3>
<p><a href="https://galliumos.org/">GalliumOS</a> Desktop (latest), verbosely:</p>

<h3 id="recommendations">recommendations</h3>
<p>Chromebooks perform best with lighter-weight operating systems and desktop environments, and they often require updated kernel drivers to support their new and tightly integrated hardware.</p>
<p>Selecting a distribution which meets these needs is therefore an important part of Linux-on-Chromebook happiness. While any updated distro will work for ordinary tasks, there are a few that stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GalliumOS</strong> is optimized specifically for Chromebooks. It scores well on all metrics, looks great, and installs quickly. Some memory-hungry applications (e.g. Steam games) perform <em>best</em> on GalliumOS thanks to careful optimizations. GalliumOS is the default distro installed by <strong>chrx</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Lubuntu</strong> also scores and performs well. It uses significantly less RAM than other distros.</li>
<li><strong>Xubuntu</strong> is another good choice. It&rsquo;s a bit heavier-weight than Lubuntu, but still performs very well.</li>
<li><strong>Fedora</strong> comes in several &ldquo;spins&rdquo; (desktop environments, selected with <code>-e ENVIRONMENT</code>), some of which (lxde) are lightweight, and some of which (desktop (gnome), default) are heavier. A few sample spins have been added to measurements below.</li>
<li>I would not choose standard, full, Ubuntu for a Chromebook. It is perfectly usable, bit it&rsquo;s heavier and suffers in performance, without offering any important benefits. Memory use starts higher and increases much more quickly as you use the desktop apps (not reflected in measurements below). If your Chromebook model has 4GB of RAM, the performance differences are reduced but not eliminated.</li>

<p><strong>chrx</strong> is a command-line installer which requires requires no physical
media or other preparation to install. It allows you to dual-boot, so you
can choose Linux or ChromeOS each time you turn on your Chromebook. This
is a flexible setup, well-suited for many users, but of course not all.</p>
<p>Consider these alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-Boot instead of dual-boot. If you don&rsquo;t need or want ChromeOS,
you don&rsquo;t need to keep it. You can install directly from a Linux ISO
written to a USB/SD device. As with dual-boot, you might need to update
firmware (full ROM/UEFI is recommended for single-boot only), and
<a href="https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing">GalliumOS</a> is the distro of choice.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">Crouton</a> allows you to run ChromeOS
and Linux simultaneously, instead of dual-booting like <strong>chrx</strong>.
This arrangement has a few drawbacks, but if you spend most of your time in
ChromeOS and your Linux needs are limited, it should serve well.</li>
<li><a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/containers_and_vms.md">Crostini</a> is Google&rsquo;s Linux-apps-in-containers-inside-virtual-machines-on-ChromeOS project. It&rsquo;s only available on newer Chromebook models, so be sure to check the compatibility list first.</li>
