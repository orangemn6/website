      <description>Plagiarism in Free Software Note: the opinions expressed here are solely mine. (Duh)
Something that I take rather seriously is the copying and redistibution without credit (intentionally or otherwise) of free software, i.e. plagiarism.
There&amp;rsquo;s a huge difference between something being in the public domain and being free and open source. The latter has a license, for one, and the purpose of it being under license is to preserve the rights of the author(s) to their work(s) but some people either misunderstand or ignore that distinction.</description>
