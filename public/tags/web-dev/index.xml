      <description>I get it.
You’re not a big fan of desktop apps built using Electron.
You want me to stop writing about them.
You don’t intend to use them.
You flat out hate them.
I hear you loud and clear.
And yet…
Electron Apps Aren’t All That Bad, Folks Rather like Mono¹ apps a few years back, Electron apps have a really bad rep among Linux users.
They’re seen as the new evil incarnate; a trojan framework here to siphon off native app development for the benefit of a shadowy, Linux-hating cabal.</description>

When you log on you are connected to the queue. The queue looks something like this:
Sometimes the queue can even go up to 8000 players! Well, with this method you can practically skip the queue completely.
The way this works is by using a proxy that you can connect to the queue with from your phone.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest issues in programming is dealing with maintenance. In a real-world scenario, we don&amp;rsquo;t always start developing projects from scratch. Mostly, we are assigned (or take) a project that has already been written maybe a couple of years before or even longer.
To work efficiently on that project, first we need to understand the source code. This is the point when we immediately realize the importance of **clean code.</description>
